- Marker snippet: Synaptic input-output communication represents a fundamental distinction among neuron types and is determined by connectivity, responsiveness, and release of neurotransmitters/ peptides.20 We explored gene families that control these functions and found differential expression between the ENCs (Fig. 2a-d; Supplementary
- Location snippet: Abstract Human NaV1.9 (hNaV1.9), encoded by SCN11A, is preferentially expressed in nociceptors, and its mutations have been linked to pain disorders. NaV1.9 could be a promising drug target for pain relief. However, the modulation of NaV1.9 activity has remained elusive. Here, we identified a new candidate NaV1.9-inter

- Marker snippet: SUMMARY We developed a spatially-tracked single neuron transcriptomics map of an intrinsic cardiac ganglion, the right atrial ganglionic plexus (RAGP) that is a critical mediator of sinoatrial node (SAN) activity. This 3D representation of RAGP used neuronal tracing to extensively map the spatial distribution of the su

- Marker snippet: in only 8% of myenteric neurons. Instead, the observation that some neurons had increased and others decreased GCaMP activity in response to each trophic factor suggests that both direct and indirect effects were measured and that responses depend on synaptic inputs, as conﬁrmed by TTX data. The hypothesis that GDNF an
