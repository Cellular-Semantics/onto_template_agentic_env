a8 and /32-@4) encode proteins that assemble to form oligomeric 
complexes (reviewed by  Schuetze and Role,  1987; Deneris et 
al.,  1991; Role,  1992; Sargent, 1993)  possibly in  the  stoichi- 
ometry  2cu:3@ (Cooper et al.,  1991). The efficiency of transmis- 
sion at neuronal nicotinic  synapses will  depend on a number of 
AChR  properties including their single-channel conductance and 
kinetics, as well as their  distribution,  agonist affinity,  desensi- 
tization  state, and overall ability  to function. While the observed 
heterogeneity in  the conductance of  neuronal AChR  channels 
can be explained by  diversity  in  subunit  composition,  other 
AChR  properties are regulated posttranslationally by  cellular 
interactions and mechanisms that  include second messenger- 
mediated signaling pathways. 

Second messenger pathways typically  culminate  in  protein 
phosphorylation, which  is known  to  regulate the properties of 
both  voltage-  and  ligand-gated ion  channels (Levitan,  1988; 
Levitan  and Kaczmarek,  1991)  including  non-NMDA  gluta- 
mate receptors (Greengard et al.,  199 1; Wang et al.,  199 1) and 
nicotinic  AChRs (Huganir et al.,  1986; Miles et al.,  1989; Hu- 
ganir and Greengard, 1990). Both  the  inositol  phosphate (IP) 
and  CAMP  signaling pathways have  been shown to  regulate 
neuronal AChR  function  (reviewed by  Sargent, 1993; Swope et 
al.,  1993). Using phorbol esters to  mimic  activation  of  the  IP 
pathway  enhances the  desensitization rate of  AChRs  on chick 
sympathetic ganglion neurons (Downing and Role, 1987). Sub- 
stance P (SP), a peptide known to activate  the IP  pathway, has 
an effect similar to  phorbol esters in  sympathetic (Role,  1984; 
Simmons et al., 1990) and ciliary  ganglion neurons (Role, 1984; 
Margiotta  and Berg, 1986). SP may function  as an endogenous 
AChR  modulator in vivo since SP-like immunoreactivity  is pres- 
ent in both sympathetic (Hayashi et al.,  1983) and ciliary ganglia 
(Reiner,  1987). Ciliary  ganglion neurons are also regulated by 
a CAMP-dependent mechanism (Margiotta  et al.,  1987a; Mar- 
giotta  and Gurantz,  1989). Treating  the  neurons with  mem- 
brane-permeant analogs of  CAMP  and a phosphodiesterase in- 
hibitor  produces a twofold  increase in ACh  sensitivity  within  6 
hr,  and intracellular  application  of  CAMP  causes a  >60%  en- 
hancement of ACh  sensitivity  within  minutes. The increase in 
ACh  sensitivity  is independent of  protein  synthesis and is not 
accompanied by detectable changes in either AChR  single-chan- 
nel conductance or kinetics. To  account for  the increase, it  was 
concluded that  CAMP  triggers a conversion of  nonfunctional 
AChRs  in  the  neuronal plasma membrane to  a  functionally 
available state (Margiotta  et al.,  1987a), possibly as a result of 
CAMP-dependent phosphorylation. The CAMP-dependent con- 
version hypothesis is consistent with earlier studies showing that 
only  a small fraction  of surface AChRs on ciliary  ganglion neu- 
rons is functional  under  control  conditions  (Margiotta  et  al., 
1987b; Margiotta  and Gurantz,  1989) and that  the phosphor-

In  contrast  with 

the  ability  of  CAMP 

to  enhance  ACh  sensi- 
tivity  in neurons, elevating CAMP in muscle increases the AChR 
desensitization rate (Middleton  et  al.,  1988). Calcitonin gene- 
related peptide (CGRP) is a potent modulator of muscle AChRs 
that  increases both the rate of AChR  desensitization (Mulle  et 
al.,  1988) and 
ylation  (Miles  et al.,  1989). In  addition,  CGRP  immunoreac- 
tivity 
is present in  motoneurons (Fontaine et  al.,  1986; New 
and Mudge,  1986) and in motor  endplate terminals (Takami et

Until 

now,  modulators 

or  “first  messengers” 

that 

regulate 

neuronal AChRs via the CAMP  signaling pathway have not been 
identified.  Vasoactive  intestinal  peptide  (VIP)  can  modulate 
neuronal nicotinic  transmission presynaptically  by  enhancing 
ACh  release (Takahashi et  al.,  1992)  and postsynaptically by 
increasing the excitability  of myenteric neurons (Willard,  1990). 
VIP-like  immunoreactivity  is observed in  nerve terminals dis- 
tributed  throughout  the  nervous system (Power et  al.,  1988; 
Sundler et al.,  1988; reviewed by Gozes and Brenneman, 1989) 
and is often colocalized with  ACh  (Hockfelt  et al.,  1980; Lund- 
berg, 1980; Eckenstein and Baughman, 1984; Whittaker,  1989), 
as occurs in preganglionic 
(Reiner, 1987). The colocalization with ACh suggests that a VIP- 
(Said,  1986; 
like  peptide  may  act  as  a  cholinergic 
Willard,  1990) since VIP  is known to be released from  presyn- 
aptic  terminals by  depolarization  (Giachetti  et  al.,  1977; re- 
viewed by  Whittaker,  1989). In  addition,  VIP  has been shown 
to increase levels ofintracellular  CAMP in brain and sympathetic

VIP 
(Adams et  al.,  1991, 1993) to  monitor  the effects of 
imaging 
VIP  and CGRP application on levels of free intracellular CAMP 
in  individual  ciliary  ganglion neurons. In  16 of  17 neurons in- 
jected  with  the fluorescent labeled reporter  enzyme FlCRhR, 
subsequent bath application of 1 PM  VIP  caused a rapid increase 
in  fluorescence ratio,  indicative  of  increased free intracellular 
CAMP.  The signal was maximal after  l-2  min (Figs. 1, 2A)  and 
was usually sustained in the presence of VIP  for  at least 30 min. 
Similar results were obtained after the application of 2 mM 8Br- 
CAMP,  a membrane-permeant CAMP  analog (data not  shown). 
Application  of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor  IBMX  (l-2  mM) 
also produced a CAMP  increase (Figs. 1, 2A)  that  appeared to 
saturate the reporter enzyme since addition of 2 mM 8Br-CAMP 
did not increase the fluorescence ratio signal further (not shown). 
Application  of 20 PM 
forskolin, which activates adenylyl cyclase 
directly (Seamon and Daly,  1986) also produced increased CAMP 
levels that  were similar in  magnitude to those seen with  IBMX 
(n =  4 neurons; data not  shown). In  contrast with  the effects of 
VIP,  IBMX,  and forskolin,  1 FM  chick CGRP did  not increase 
intracellular CAMP  lcvcls above baseline. In  12 neurons tested, 
bath  application of  CGRP  caused no detectable change in the 
level  of  free  CAMP  after  l-10  min,  while  IBMX 
induced a 
substantial increase in  the same cells (e.g., Fig.  2B). 

The ability  of  VIP  to  increase the  level  of  free cytoplasmic 
CAMP in individual  ciliary ganglion neurons was confirmed with 
a competitive binding assay that measures the total cellular level 
of CAMP  (bound plus free) in the neurons. Dissociated neurons 
were incubated in duplicate dishes at 5-l  5 ganglion equivalents/ 
dish for  10 min in  recording solution supplemented with  10% 
horse serum, or in  the same solution containing VIP  (1 WM)  or 
forskolin (20 PM).

Figure  2.  VIP,  but not CGRP, rapidly increases free CAMP levels in ciliary ganglion neurons. Experimental results are presented as the emission 
intensity ratio of fluorescein to rhodamine (500-530 nm:570 nm) for two separate neurons plotted against time. Following a control period, 1 PM 
chick VIP  (A) or 1 PM  chick CGRP (B) was applied. For VIP, the ratio increased in 16 of 17 cells tested (e.g., A) indicating an increase in neuronal 
CAMP concentration. Application of CGRP produced no detectable change of the ratio in 12 cells tested (e.g., B). Addition of 1 mM IBMX  resulted 
in increased CAMP levels in the neurons following both types of treatments (A and B). The ratio measurements were taken at about 1 min intervals, 
and the data points representing each ratio value were connected. The dashed  vertical  lines  separate the different treatments and are drawn at the 
time of drug addition. 

than  in  untreated controls (125  f  22 fmol/ganglion). Raising 
the VIP  concentration from  1 PM 
to  10 PM  produced only  a lO- 
20% additional increase in CAMP accumulation (data not shown), 
suggesting that  1 PM  VIP  is a near-maximal dose. Using the 
forskolin also produced a robust increase in 
same assay, 20 PM 
total  CAMP levels to >4000  fmol/ganglia. Both the imaging and 
the competition binding experiments reveal that brief exposures 
to  VIP  lead to  increased levels of  CAMP  in  the  neurons. The 
imaging experiments further indicate that VIP  elevates free neu- 
ronal CAMP,  and suggest that  such elevation can account for  at 
least some of the total  increase. 

ACh  sensitivity.  We  next  examined the  ability  of  VIP  and 
CGRP  to  enhance neuronal ACh  sensitivity.  Previous studies 
showed that  ACh  at concentrations of  0.5-1.0  mM maximally 
activated functional AChRs on El 3,14 ciliary ganglion neurons, 
and that  such responses are enhanced twofold by incubating the 
neurons with  8Br-CAMP  and IBMX 
for  6  hr  (Margiotta  and 
Gurantz,  1989). Since CAMP  levels were increased within  min- 
utes by  VIP  (Figs. 1, 2) and 8Br-CAMP  but  not  by  CGRP,  we 
compared the ability  of  8Br-CAMP,  VIP,  and CGRP  to  alter 
ACh  responses of  ciliary  ganglion neurons following  brief  in- 
cubations. Freshly dissociated E 13,14 ciliary  ganglion neurons 
were incubated at  37°C for  lo-15  min,  either in recording so- 
lution  alone or  in  recording solution  containing VIP  (1  PM), 
CGRP  (1 PM),  or  8Br-CAMP  (2  mM). The  neurons were then 
tested for  responses to  ACh  in  the  presence of  the same con- 
centration  of test agents at room temperature. Consistent with 
their  effects on intracellular  CAMP  levels, both  VIP  and 8Br- 
CAMP  significantly  increased the  peak ACh-induced  conduc- 
tance and  the  maximal  conductance (G,)  following  the  brief 
incubations (Fig.  3). In  52 neurons treated with  VIP  for  a total 
of  1 O-60 min, the maximal conductance response in VIP-treated 
neurons normalized per unit  membrane capacitance (G,)  was 
6.53  +  0.55 nS/pF,  compared with  4.35  ?  0.31 nS/pF  for  55 

untreated controls (p  <  0.001). The  ability  of  VIP  to  enhance 
the ACh  response did not appear to result from  a direct change 
in resting membrane conductance. Application  of recording so- 
lution containing 1 PM  VIP  induced only a small outward current 
of  2040  pA  (n  =  6 neurons) that  coincided with  the pressure 
pulse, and was not  detectably  different  from  the  current  pro- 
duced by application of recording solution alone. The magnitude 
of  the  increase in  ACh  response produced by  VIP  was also 
expressed relative to the mean G, for  untreated control neurons 
in  the  same experiment.  Using this approach, the mean ACh 
response was seen to  increase by  52 +  11% after neurons were 
treated with  VIP  (Fig.  3B, Table  1). A  similar enhancement of 
80  f  17% was observed after  brief  incubations in  8Br-CAMP 
(Fig. 3B, Table 1). The 80% increase in neuronal ACh  sensitivity 
following treatment with  8Br-CAMP  is in good agreement with 
the 66% increase reported previously  for  ciliary  ganglion neu-

Vijayaraghavan  et  al.,  1990).  Minutes  after  exposure

the  neurons  displayed  sustained 

in  the  CAMP-dependent 

CAMP  and ACh  sensitivity.  The coordinated increases in neu- 
ronal  CAMP  and ACh  sensitivity  following  exposure to  VIP 
suggest that  the peptide accomplishes both effects by  activating 
the  CAMP-dependent  signaling pathway.  This  conclusion is 
strengthened by  experiments where VIP  and 8Br-CAMP  were 
applied, either separately or in combination. The results reveal 
increased neuronal ACh  sensitivity  shortly  after  each reagent 
was applied separately, but  no  added enhancement when the 
two were applied together. Given  the relatively  small size of the 
enhancements produced by the individual  treatments (50-80%) 
compared with those seen after longer incubations in 8Br-CAMP 
(loo-200%  after 6 hr;  Margiotta  et al.,  1987a), it  seems unlikely 
that  the lack  of  additivity  represents a simple ceiling effect at 
the AChR  level. Instead, the results suggest that  the individual 
treatments increase neuronal CAMP  sufficiently to  saturate ini- 
tially  a downstream component of the signaling pathway, pos- 
sibly  the  PKA.  It  seems likely  that  the  increase in  neuronal 
CAMP  results from activation  of a VIP-like  peptide receptor. A 
VIP  receptor cDNA  clone that  elevates CAMP  in  transfected 
cells has recently been isolated, and VIP  receptor mRNA  tran- 
scripts detected in  rat  brain  (Ishihara et  al.,  1993). Thus, the 
simplest conclusion from our observations is that VIP,  presum- 
ably  by  acting on its own receptor, modulates neuronal AChR 
function  by  rapidly  increasing the  levels of  free  intracellular 
CAMP. 

In contrast with  the effects of VIP  on ciliary ganglion neurons, 
CGRP, a peptide associated with CAMP-dependent modulation 
of  muscle AChRs  but  without  detectable homology  to  VIP, 
produced neither an increase in free CAMP  nor a change in the 
size or  kinetics of  the neuronal ACh  response. Peptide degra- 
dation  cannot  explain  the  absence of  a  CGRP  effect  on  the 
neurons; when applied to myotubes in culture without  peptidase 
inhibitors,  CGRP  was still able to induce AChR  phosphoryla- 
tion  (Miles  et  al.,  1989). The  inability  of  CGRP  to  alter ACh 
responses or intracellular levels of CAMP here may indicate that 
ciliary  ganglion neurons lack CGRP receptors coupled to CAMP. 
Substantial VIP-induced  increases in  CAMP  were detected 
within minutes in individual ciliary ganglion neurons using CAMP 
imaging, and in  populations of  the  neurons using a standard 
competition  binding assay. The imaging experiments indicate 
that  at least some of the increased CAMP  freely associates with

in  sympathetic  ganglia  (MO  and  Dun,  1984) 
and  increased  excitability  of  postsynaptic  neurons  at  nicotinic

such  postsynaptic  effects  to  the  present  results  seems  doubtful, 
however,  since  VIP  did  not  detectably  alter  the  holding  current

nicotinic  AChR 
function  observed  here  represents  a  distinct 
biological  activity  of  VIP,  or  a  related  peptide.  Such  AChR 
modulation  may  involve  a  CAMP-dependent 
increase  in  the

population  on  ciliary  ganglion  neurons,  and  thereby  have  rel- 
evance  over  periods 
that  include  and  extend  beyond  episodes 
of  synaptic  activity.
