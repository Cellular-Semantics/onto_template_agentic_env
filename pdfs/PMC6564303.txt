Abstract 

Dissociated  cell  cultures  prepared  from  fetal  mouse  spinal  cords  and  dorsal  root  ganglia  were 
stained  for  endogenous  substance  P  using  the  peroxidase-antiperoxidase 
technique.  Substance  P- 
like  immunoreactivity  was  localized  within  a  small  percentage  of  rounded  or  multipolar  neuronal 
somata  and  in  varicose  processes. The  substance  P-positive  multipolar  neurons  were  derived  from 
spinal  cord,  while  the  small  rounded  neurons  were  possibly  of  spinal  cord  and/or  sensory  ganglion 
origin.  Large  dorsal  root  ganglion  neurons  were  unreactive. 

These  results  are  consistent  with  in  viva  findings  and  indicate  the  feasibility  of  electrophysiologic 
studies in  culture  to  analyze  the  synaptic  connections  between  substance  P  neurons  and  their  target 
cells. 

The  undecapeptide,  substance  P, has been localized  by 
immunocytochemistry 
in  neuronal  somata  in  spinal  sen- 
sory  ganglia  (Hiikfelt  et  al.,  1975a, b,  1976) and  in  occa- 
sional  cell  bodies in  the  dorsal  spinal  cord  (Hijkfelt  et  al., 
1977; Ljungdahl  et  al.,  1978). Immunoreactive 
fibers  are 
found  in  spinal  cord  laminae  containing  sensory  fibers 
(Hokfelt  et  al.,  1975a,  b).  This 
and  their 
in  the  spinal  cord  in  the 
peptide  is believed  to  function 
related  to  nociception 
processing of  sensory  information 
(Henry,  1976;  Henry  et  al.,  1980;  Randid  and  Miletid, 
1977). 

terminations 

In  the  present  study,  neurons  of  the  fetal  mouse spinal 
cord  (SC)  and  dorsal  root  ganglia  (DRG),  maintained  in 
dissociated  cell  culture,  were  examined  for  immunoreac- 
tivity 
to 
determine  whether  substance P-containing  neurons  were 
present  in  SC-DRG  cultures  and,  if  so, to  define  which 
morphologic  features  might  distinguish  them.  The  SC-

DRG  cell  cultures,  showing  essentially  two-dimensional 
anatomy,  have  been  used  effectively 
for  electrophysio- 
logic  studies  of  synaptically  connected  cells  (Macdonald 
and  Nelson,  1978;  Nelson  et  al.,  1977;  Ransom  et  al., 
1977a, b)  and  for  detailed  analyses  of  the  morphology 
and  synaptic  relationships  of  physiologically  studied  and 
labeled  neurons  (E.  A.  Neale  et  al.,  1978; 
selectively 
Nelson  et  al.,  1978). The  ability 
to  identify  substance  P 
neurons  in  cultures  would  allow  further  analyses of  (a) 
electrophysiologic  characteristics  of  the  substance P neu- 
ron,  (b)  synaptic  relationships  with  other  peptide-con- 
taining  neurons,  and  (c)  possible coexistence  of substance 
P  with  a  particular  neurotransmitter  and/or  an  addi- 
tional  peptide. 

Materials  and  Methods 

Tissue  cultures.  Dissociated  cell  cultures  were  pre- 
pared  from  13-  to  15-day  fetal  mouse  spinal  cords  and 
dorsal  root  ganglia  as previously  described  (Ransom  et 
al.,  1977c). For  immunocytochemistry, 
cultures  grown  in 
35-mm  plastic  culture  dishes  were  used  routinely,  al- 
though,  occasionally,  cultures  grown  on  glass coverslips 
were  stained.  Fifteen  cultures, 
four  dissections, 
ranging  in  age  from  5  to  12 weeks,  were  treated  with 
nerve  growth  factor  (2.5  S NGF  at  a final  concentration 
of  40 rig/ml) 
two 
rinses in  0.1 M  sodium  phosphate  buffer,  pH  7.3, cultures 
were  fixed  for  90 min  at  room  temperature  with  freshly

Fixed  cultures  were  treated 

with  two  changes (5 min  each)  of  PBS  containing  0.125%

for  13 to  19 hr  at  4°C  in  a  moist  chamber,  after  which, 
they  were  reacted  sequentially  with  sheep antiserum  to

(1: 100)  and  rabbit  peroxidase-antiper- 
oxidase  complexes  (Sternberger,  1979) at  a 1:400 dilution 
as previously  described  (Zimmerman  and Antunes,  1976) 
for  periods  of  90 min  each.  All  antisera  were  diluted  with 
PBS  containing  0.25% Triton  X-100.  The  cultures  were 
washed  between  each  step  with  PBS  containing  0.125%

substance  P  (Immuno  Nuclear  Corp.,  Stillwater,  MN) 
per  ml.  After 
the  immunoperoxidase  reaction  was com- 
plete,  the  cultures  were  osmicated,  dehydrated,  and  em- 
bedded  in  Epon  for  convenient  storage. 

Results 

Dissociated  cell  cultures,  prepared  from  fetal  mouse 
spinal  cords  and  dorsal  root  ganglia  and  maintained 
for 
more  than  4  weeks,  were  stained  for  substance  P-like 
immunoreactivity.  Substance  P  was detected  in  cultures 
fixed  by  several  methods,  although  the  initial  fixation 
in 
freshly  prepared  4% paraformaldehyde  yielded  optimal 
cell  preservation,  strong  staining,  low  background,  and 
minimum  contamination  with  nonspecific  precipitates. 
Antiserum  was tested  at  several  concentrations;  a 1:lOOO 
dilution  yielded  distinct  staining  with

The  general  morphology  of  the  neurons  in  “mature” 
SC-DRG  cultures  has been described  (Nelson  et al.,  1981; 
Ransom  et  al.,  1977c). Briefly,  one large  (-40-pm-diam- 
eter)  bulbous  cell  type  was identified  unequivocally  by 
electrophysiologic  and  morphologic  criteria  as  a  DRG

neuron.  Large  (>30-pm-diameter)  multipolar 
which  spontaneous  excitatory  and  inhibitory 
synaptic 
activity  was  recorded  were  assumed to  be  SC  neurons. 
The  remainder  of the  neurons  were  small and multipolar, 
presumably  derived  from  SC,  or  were  small  and  rounded 
and  could  have  originated  from  either  SC  or  DRG.  Cul- 
tures  prepared  from  DRG  alone and  grown  in  the  contin- 
uous  presence  of  NGF  contained 
large  neurons  with 
round  somata  of  rather  uniform  size;  no  multipolar  neu- 
rons were  found  in  these  “pure”  DRG  cultures.  Cultures 
prepared 
the  DRGs  were 
removed  and  regardless  of  whether  NGF  were  present 
contained  all  of  the  cell types  mentioned  except  the  large 
bulbous  neuron.

neuronal  “background” 
Staining  was  detected  most  easily  when  preparations 
were  viewed  with  dark-field  optics  (Fig.  1B)  although 
morphologic  details  were  best  studied  using  bright-field 
and  phase contrast  microscopy. 

A  frequent  staining  pattern  was  that  of  an  isolated 
network  of  beaded  processes with  no stained  cell body  in 
evidence.  A  small  percentage  of  neuronal  somata  were 
clearly  stained,  however,  and  these  cells fell  into  one  of 
three  morphologic  types.  The  most  commonly  occurring 
neuronal  soma that  displayed  substance P-like  immuno- 
reactivity  was densely  stained,  small  (-20  pm  diameter), 
and  rounded  and  associated  with  a  complex  of  delicate 
beaded  processes which  could  not,  however,  be  traced 
to  a  point  of  emergence  from  the  soma 
unambiguously 
(Figs.  2A  and  3,  A  to  E).  A  second  stained  cell  type 
closely  resembled  the  small round  cell  in  size, shape, and 
dense  uniform  stain,  although  several  processes were 
seen clearly  to  emanate  from  the  soma (Fig.  3, F  to  I).  A 
third  cell  type,  the  least  frequently  seen,  was  the  dis- 
tinctly  multipolar  neuron  (Figs.  4B  and  5)  ranging  in 
diameter 
to  30  pm  and  with  up  to  seven 
emerging  cell  processes.  The  brown  reaction  product 
these  somata  appeared  perinuclear  and  punctate 
within 
and  paler  than  that  in  the  small  round  cells. Because of 
their  multipolar  morphology, 
the  second  and  third 
stained  cell  types  are  most  probably  SC  neurons.  On 
to  classify 
morphologic  criteria  alone, it  would  be difficult 
the  first  cell  type  as either  SC  or  DRG.  However,  large 
DRG  neurons  clearly  were  not  immunoreactive 
for  sub- 
stance  P  (Fig.  3C,  arrow)  and  typically  were  devoid  of 
contacts  by  stained  processes. 

from  -15 

Generally,  all  processes emerging  from  a  given  cell 
were  equivalently  stained;  staining  was not  distinctive 
to 
one process that  might  be identified  as the  axon.  Immu- 
noreactive  processes were  unfailingly  varicose  (Fig.  6A ) 
and  easily  discriminated 
from  the  unstained  processes 
with  which  they  were  associated (Fig.  6C).  Relationships 
between  stained  and unstained  cells ranged from  contacts 
comprised  of  only  a  few  stained  swellings  (Fig.  4C)  to 
rather  heavy 
in  which  unstained  neuronal 
somata  were  enclosed  by  “baskets”  of  stained  processes 
(Figs.  2B  and  6B).  Apparent  autaptic  contacts  between 
a neuron  and  a branch  of  its  own  axon  (van  der  Loos and 
Glaser,  1972) were  seen occasionally  (Figs. 4B  and  50).

Discussion 

There  are  a number  of  issues involved 

in  the  identifi- 
cation  of  the  neurons  showing  substance  P-like  immu- 
noreactivity 

in  dissociated  SC-DRG  cell  cultures. 

Reactive  somata  comprised  a  small  percentage  (less 
total  neuronal  population.  Of  those 

than  5%)  of  the 
neurons  with  reaction  product  in the  cell body,  a minority 
showed  the  characteristic  morphology  of  multipolar  SC 
neurons.  That  substance  P-like  immunoreactivity  was 
in  SC  neurons  is  consistent  with  reports 
demonstrated 
that  cell  bodies  in  intact  SC  (laminae  I  to  V)  could  be 
stained  after  local  injection  of  colchicine  (Hokfelt  et  al., 
1977; Ljungdahl  et al.,  1978). Colchicine  treatment  of  SC- 
DRG  cultures  did  not  appear  to  increase  the  frequency 
of  stained  neurons.  Similarly,  colchicine  was not  greatly 
in  increasing  either  the  intensity  or  frequency

Nonetheless,  these  in  situ  immunocytochemical 
tech- 
niques allow  initial  electrophysiologic  analysis  of selected 
small neurons to  be followed  by  subsequent  identification 
of  substance P cells. The  enrichment  of  cultures  for  small 
neurons  (Schnaar  and  Schaffner,  1981) ultimately  could 
increase  the  possibilities  for  study  of  substance  P  neu- 
ronal  physiology. 

Neurons  in  dissociated  SC-DRG  cell  cultures  contain 
a  variety  of  neuropeptides  (Matthew  et  al.,  1979; J.  H. 
Neale  et  al.,  1978; Nelson  et  al.,  1980). The  anatomical
