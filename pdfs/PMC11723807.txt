Abstract

NaV1.9 is of interest to the pain community for a number of reasons, including the human 
mutations in the gene encoding NaV1.9, SCN11a, that are associated with both pain and loss of 
pain phenotypes. However, because much of what we know about the biophysical properties of 
NaV1.9 has been learned through the study of rodent sensory neurons, and there is only 76% 
identity between human and rodent homologs of SCN11a, there is reason to suggest that there 
may be differences in the biophysical properties of the channels in human and rodent sensory 
neurons, and consequently, the contribution of these channels to the control of sensory neuron 
excitability, if not pain. Thus, the purpose of this study was to characterize NaV1.9 currents 
in human sensory neurons and compare the properties of these currents to those in rat sensory 
neurons recorded under identical conditions. Whole cell patch techniques were used to record 
NaV1.9 currents in isolated sensory neurons in vitro. Our results indicate that several of the core 
biophysical properties of the currents including persistence and a low threshold for activation are 
the conserved across species. However, we noted a number of potentially important differences 
between the currents in human and rat sensory neurons including a lower threshold for activation, 
higher threshold for inactivation, slower deactivation, and faster recovery from slow inactivation. 
Human NaV1.9 was inhibited by inflammatory mediators, while rat NaV1.9 was potentiated. Our 
results may have implications for the role of NaV1.9 in sensory, if not nociceptive signaling.

Introduction

Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are generally thought of in the context of action 
potential generation and propagation, and eight of the nine VGSC alpha subunits expressed 
in mammalian tissues have been shown to contribute to action potential generation and/or 
propagation [6]. However, the ninth VGSC alpha subunit, NaV1.9, appears to be so slowly 
activating and inactivating [7; 22], at least at room temperature [40], that it appears to play

a very different role in the control of neuronal excitability, largely impacting the resting 
membrane potential, and therefore only indirectly influencing action potential generation 
[9]. Nevertheless, NaV1.9 has remained a channel of interest to the pain research community 
for a number of reasons. First, it is only expressed in the peripheral sensory [10] and enteric 
[33; 37] neurons, and appears to be enriched in putative nociceptive afferents responsible 
for pain associated with tissue injury [12]. Second, NaV1.9 currents are increased by 
proinflammatory mediators [2; 3; 16; 27; 38], suggesting that NaV1.9 contributes to the 
sensitization of nociceptive afferents thought to underlie inflammatory hyperalgesia. Third, 
while data from NaV1.9 null mutant mice suggests the channel contributes little to baseline 
nociceptive thresholds [35], consistent with the data from isolated neurons and ex-vivo 
preparations [16], it appears to contribute to hypersensitivity evoked by pro-inflammatory 
mediators [16; 38], as well as complete Freund’s adjuvant-induced inflammation [35], or 
supernatant from inflamed human tissue applied to the gut [16]. In the skin, NaV1.9 appears 
to play a more prominent role in heat than mechanical hypersensitivity [34; 35], while in 
the gut, NaV1.9 contributes to hypersensitivity to slow rather than rapid stretch of the colon 
[16]. Finally, mutations in SCN11a, the gene encoding NaV1.9, are associated with both loss 
of function (insensitivity to pain) and gain of function (chronic pain) phenotypes [9]. The 
contribution of NaV1.9 to neuropathic pain has yet to be fully characterized with largely 
negative results in preclinical studies ([34; 35], but see [24; 26]), and a gain of function 
mutation of NaV1.9 associated with neuropathic pain patients [19]. Taken together, these 
data suggest NaV1.9 may play a particularly important role in inflammatory hypersensitivity 
in both animal models and humans.

Despite its potential importance in inflammatory if not neuropathic pain syndromes, 
virtually all that is known about the biophysical and pharmacological properties of NaV1.9 
currents has been obtained through the study of rodent sensory neurons and heterologous 
expression systems. There is a report of NaV1.9 currents in human DRG neurons, in which 
recordings were obtained from 14 neurons, nine of which had measurable levels of persistent 
(NaV1.9-like) currents [11]. Yet given that rat and mouse homologs of SCN11a share 
only 76% identity with human SCN11a [8; 22], species differences in both biophysical 
and pharmacological properties should not be surprising [22]. Furthermore, given evidence 
of the impact of heterologous expression systems on the biophysical and pharmacological 
properties of VGSCs [29], it is important to characterize VGSCs in their native environment. 
Thus, the goal of the present study was to characterize NaV1.9 currents in human DRG 
neurons.

Collection of human DRGs

The detailed methods for collection of L4 and L5 DRGs have been described in our previous 
reports ([15; 30; 31; 41–43]). Briefly, after L4 and L5 ganglia were recovered, the ganglia 
were placed in ice cold collection media with the following composition: 129.5 mM NaCl, 
5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 30 mM HEPES, 2.5 mM glucose and 0.23% phosphoric acid 
adjusted with Tris Base to a pH of 7.35.

Isolation of human DRG neurons

The protocol employed has been described in our previous studies ([31]). Briefly, ganglia 
were cut into small (~2–5 mm3) pieces and transferred to collection media containing 1 
mg/mL of collagenase P (Roche Bioscience), 1 mg/mL of Trypsin (TRL, Worthington) 
and 0.1 mg/mL DNase 1 (Roche Bioscience), and placed on a shaking tray in a 37°C 
water bath. Fresh enzyme solution was added every 90 minutes. The enzymatic treatment 
was terminated when pieces of ganglia began to visibly fall apart. Pieces of ganglia were 
transferred to a 15 mL tube and mechanically dissociated through a fire-polished Pasteur 
pipette. Enzymatic activity was quenched by adding 7 mL of collection media supplemented 
with 2 mg/mL soybean trypsin inhibitor (type II, Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mg/mL bovine serum 
albumin (Sigma-Aldrich), fetal bovine serum (to a final concentration of 10%, Hyclone), and 
2 mM CaCl2, and dispersed cells were centrifuged at 450G for 4 minutes. The pellet was 
re-suspended in a Leibovitz L-15 (Invitrogen) based media (basal media) containing (per 
500 mL): 60 mg imidizole, 15 mg aspartic acid, 15 mg glutamic acid, 15 mg cystine, 5 mg 
β-alanine, 10 mg myo-inositol, 10 mg choline-Cl, 5 mg p-aminobenzoic acid, 25 mg fumaric 
acid, 2 mg vitamin B12 and 5 mg of lipoic acid. All chemicals used to supplement the L-15 
media were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Cells were spun again for 4 minutes at 450G, the 
pellet was then resuspended in 1 mL of basal media. This was loaded on a Percoll (Sigma-
Aldrich) gradient, and spun at 1800G for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in complete 
media which was composed of basal media diluted 1:10 with fetal bovine serum and then 
supplemented to yield a final concentration of 50 ng/mL nerve growth factor (NGF 2.5S, 
Invitrogen), 0.3 mg/mL glutamine (Invitrogen), 0.225 mg/mL glucose (Sigma-Aldrich), 
2.55 mg/mL ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.12 mg/mL glutathione (Invitrogen), and 
0.2% (w/v) NaHCO3 (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were plated onto poly-L-lysine coated glass 
coverslips (Invitrogen) placed in CO2 (5%) incubator at 37℃ for 4h prior to flooding with 
Complete Media. Neurons were studied between 4 and 72 h in culture.

Isolation of rat TG and DRG neurons

Adult (250–320 g) male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (Envigo, Indianapolis, IN)) were 
used for all experiments. Adult rat DRG and trigeminal ganglia (TG) were surgically 
obtained, enzymatically treated and mechanically dissociated as previously described [25]. 
Cells were also plated on poly-L-lysine coated glass coverslips (Invitrogen), which were 
placed in 35 mm culture dishes and stored in a CO2 (5%) incubator at 37˚C for 2 hr prior to 
flooding with Complete Media. Neurons were studied between 4 and 48h of plating.

Patch clamp recording

Page 4

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed with an Axopatch 200B controlled 
with pClamp (v10.2) software (Molecular Devices, Carlsbad, CA) in combination with a 
Digidata 1320A A/D converter (Molecular Devices) or with a HEKA EPC10 controlled 
with Patchmaster software (v2×90.2). Data were acquired at 10–20 kHz and filtered at 2 
kHz. Borosilicate glass (WPI, Sarasota, FL) electrodes were 1–1.5 MΩ were filled with an 
electrode solutions containing (in mM): CsF 100, TEA-Cl 40, NaCl 5, CaCl 2 1, EGTA 11, 
HEPES 10, Mg-ATP 2, and GTP 1; pH was adjusted to 7.2 with Tris-base and osmolality 
was adjusted to 310 mOsm with sucrose. The bath solution consisted of (in mM): NaCl 35, 
CholineCl 65, TEA-Cl 30, CaCl2 0.1, MgCl2 5, CdCl2 0.1, HEPES 10, and glucose 10; 
pH was adjusted to 7.4 with Tris-Base, and the osmolality adjusted to 320 with sucrose. 
Capacitive currents were minimized with amplifier circuitry. Series resistance compensation 
was always employed, and if it was not possible to achieve compensation greater than 75%, 
neurons were not included for further analysis. Similarly, if estimated voltage errors were 
greater than 5 mV, data were not included for further analysis, where voltage errors were 
estimated based on the peak inward current across the uncompensated series resistance.

Steady-state properties:  The voltage-dependence of current activation and inactivation 
was determined with standard current-voltage (I-V) and steady-state inactivation (H-infinity) 
protocols. Neurons were held at −120 mV, total TTX-R I-V curves were generated in the 
presence of 300 nM TTX unless indicated with a series of 50 ms test pulses between −110 
and −10 mV, evoked every 5 seconds (Figure 1A), then I-V curves (NaV1.8 mediated) 
were evoked at a holding potential of −50 mV to inactivate NaV1.9. NaV1.9 currents were 
isolated from NaV1.8 currents post-hoc, via digital subtraction of the NaV1.8 I-V curves 
from the total to obtain NaV1.9 I-V curves. In a subpopulation of neurons, the putative 
NaV1.8 selective blocker A-803467 was used to block NaV1.8 currents. Of note, it was 
necessary to use 10 μM A-803467 to block NaV1.8 currents in human DRG neurons. 
Steady-state inactivation/availability curves were obtained with a voltage protocol in which 
currents were evoked by a voltage step to −50 mV following a series of 500 ms pre-pulses 
from −120 to −10 mV, the pre-pulse was increased by 10 mV increments every 5 seconds.

Kinetics:  The time constant (tau) of current activation was determined with a single 
exponential fitted to the rise phase of the current following depolarizing voltage-steps, where 
the voltage-dependence of current activation was determined from the currents evoked with 
the I-V protocols. The time constant (tau) of current inactivation was determined with a 
single exponential fitted to the decay phase of the evoked current during sustained (500 ms) 
voltage steps, where the current evoked during the conditioning voltage step used for the 
generation of steady-state inactivation curves was most often used for this purpose. The time 
constant (tau) of current deactivation was determined with a single exponential fitted to the 
decay phase of the evoked current following a repolarizing voltage-step following current 
activation with a voltage step to −50 mV. To determine the recovery of NaV1.9 currents 
from slow inactivation, currents were evoked at −50 mV from a holding potential of −120 
mV at 0.3 Hz following three minutes at a holding potential of −50 mV.

Temperature dependence:  Given a previous report suggesting that NaV1.9 currents 
may be particularly sensitive to increases in temperature, currents in neurons from a 
subgroup of donors were studied at room temperature (~20°C) and at 34°C (and in a smaller 
group of neurons at 37°C). Temperature was controlled with a feedback-controlled resistive 
heater in line with the perfusion system, where the thermocouple was positioned ~200 μm 
from the neuron studied. For comparative purposes, we assessed the impact of temperature 
controlled in the same manner on the properties of TTX-S and NaV1.8 currents.

Impact of local anesthetics:  Given the importance of local anesthetics to pain control 
we sought to assess the impact of the canonical local anesthetic lidocaine on persistent 
currents in human DRG neurons. A 150 ms test pulse to −50mV from a holding potential 
of −120 mV was applied in each neuron to evoke NaV1.9 current, and lidocaine at 
concentrations of 0.1 to 3mM was applied.

Inflammatory mediators:  Finally given evidence of a role for NaV1.9 in inflammatory 
hyperalgesia, we sought to assess the impact of an inflammatory soup consisting of PGE2, 
bradykinin, serotonin, and histamine on persistent currents. The inflammatory soup was 
applied after establishment of a stable baseline.

Test agents:  All salts used for electrophysiological recording were obtained from Sigma-
Aldrich. TTX (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in distilled water (dH2O) as a 1 mM stock 
solution, and stored at 4°C until use. Prostaglandin E2 (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 
ethanol as a 10 mM stock solution and stored at −20°C until use. Bradykinin was dissolved 
in 1% acetic acid in a10 mM stock concentration and stored at −20°C until use. Lidocaine 
was prepared as a 10 mM stock solution with 5 mM Na-HEPES buffered dH2O, with a pH 
adjusted to 7.0 with TEA-OH, and stored at −20°C until use. Drugs were diluted to final 
concentrations in bath solution from stock solutions at least 1000 times greater than the 
highest concentration employed.

Data analysis:  Amplifier circuitry was used to estimate membrane capacitance. Tail 
currents evoked following membrane repolarization to −120 mV in association with the 
I-V protocol, were used to generate conductance-voltage plots. Steady-state inactivation and 
G-V curves were fitted with modified Boltzmann equations so as to determine maximal 
conductance (Gmax), the voltage at which currents were either half inactivated or half 
activated (V0.5), as well as the slopes of the two curves. Lidocaine concentration-response 
curves were fitted with a modified Hill equation to enable estimation of the concentration 
needed to block 50% of evoked current.

All pooled data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. Unless otherwise stated, 
a t-test was used for statistical comparisons between human and rat data, where a difference 
with p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

Neurons included in this study were obtained from 33 donors (21 males and 12 females). 
The average age of the males was 38.8 years (range = 17–64 years) while that of females

was 41.8 years (range = 17–61 years). The average membrane capacitance of the 144 
human DRG neurons included in this study (i.e., those in which >200 pA of low threshold 
persistent current was detected) was 149.5 ± 5.0 pF, with a range from 42.97 to 366.2 pF. 
The average neuron capacitance per donor was 153.0 ± 4.8 pF. While rat neurons were 
not systematically analyzed for the presence of low threshold persistent current across all 
cell body sizes, average capacitance of rat neurons in which persistent current was detected 
was 32.0 ± 1.3 pF (n = 138, p < 0.01). The average neuron capacitance per rat was 32.3 
± 1.9 pF (n = 25, p < 0.01). Consistent with previous reports, rat DRG neurons with 
NaV1.9 current tended to be small with a cell body diameter < 27 μm. In contrast, NaV1.9 
currents were found in human DRG neurons of all sizes with a range that spanned the 
smallest to the largest neurons studied. Nevertheless, of the 21 human DRG neurons with 
persistent current tested for capsaicin (300 nM) sensitivity, 16 were capsaicin responsive, 
suggesting most of the human neurons with persistent current are putative nociceptors. Of 
note, while we have previously described a time in culture dependent increase in TTX-S and 
the more rapidly inactivating TTX-R currents in human sensory neurons [42], there was not 
significant influence of time in culture on NaV1.9 current density which was −47.3 ± 5.1 
pA/pF on day 0, −64.2 ± 5.7 pA/pF on day 1, but only −52.8 ± 7.2 pA/pF on day 2.

Biophysical properties of NaV1.9 currents in human and rat sensory neurons

Recordings were made in solutions chosen to minimize potential contamination of voltage-
gated Na+ currents by voltage-gated K+ or Ca2+ currents. To facilitate clamp control of 
voltage-gated Na+ currents, extracellular Na+ was reduced to 35 mM. TTX-sensitive Na+ 
currents are completely blocked in the presence of 300 nM TTX, which allowed us to record 
TTX-R Na+ current in isolation. Two approaches were used to isolate NaV1.9 from NaV1.8 
currents. One was voltage, where a depolarized holding potential (to ~−50 mV) enabled 
complete inactivation of NaV1.9 channels, but the full availability of NaV1.8 channels. Any 
inactivation of NaV1.8 currents at −50 mV could be rapidly recovered with a brief (10 ms) 
hyperpolarizing voltage step to −60 or −70 mV. This allowed digital subtraction of NaV1.8 
currents from the total current evoked from a holding potential of −120 mV, leaving NaV1.9 
currents in isolation (Figure 1A). The second approach was with A-803467, which at 10 µM 
(but not 300 nM), completely blocked NaV1.8 in human DRG neurons (Figure 1B). The 
currents isolated by both methods evoked from human and rat sensory neurons were grossly 
comparable, and had a low threshold for activation, demonstrated little fast inactivation at 
voltage steps >−50 mV, and were comparatively slowly inactivating at voltage steps to more 
depolarized potentials.

I-V data were collected from 120 human DRG neurons and 89 rat DRG and TG neurons 
under the same conditions with the same series of protocols. Pooled I-V data normalized 
to cell capacitance (Figure 1C) revealed a species difference in current density, which was 
much greater in rat sensory neurons despite the relatively large variability in current density 
from neuron to neuron. This variance is illustrated in a plot of the current density at −50 mV, 
where the violin plot is used to illustrate the distribution of current density at −50 mV per 
cell (with an n = 144 for human and 138 for rat, respectively. This “n” is larger than that for 
which there were complete I-V data, as some neurons were only studied with a test-pulse to

−50 mV) and the dot-plot overlaying the violin plot are of the mean current density per rat (n 
= 25) or human donor (n = 33) (Figure 1C inset).

While difficult to see in the I-V plots, G-V plots normalized to maximal conductance 
revealed a species difference in the voltage-dependence of current activation as well, which 
was more hyperpolarized in human DRG neurons. G-V data for each neuron was fitted 
with a Boltzmann equation to determine Gmax, and this fitted value was subsequently used 
to normalize each G-V curve prior to pooling. As with Figure 1C, variability in the G-V 
plots is illustrated in the inset to Figure 1D, where the violin plots include data from single 
neurons and the overlaying dot plots are average values from individual humans or rats. The 
V0.5 for activation in human DRG neurons was −63 ± 1.3 mV (n = 30 donors), while that 
in rat sensory neurons was −58 ± 0.9 mV (n = 25 rats). The difference in V0.5 of activation 
between groups is significant (p < 0.05). However, there were no differences between groups 
with respect to the slope of the G-V curves, which was 6.7 ± 0.3 (n = 32) and 6.9 ± 0.3 (n = 
25) mV/e-fold change in conductance in sensory neurons from human and rat, respectively.

While no power analyses were performed prior to the start of this study to determine the 
number of donors needed to detect an influence of demographic or other donor variables 
on current density, we did perform a post-hoc analyses to assess the potential influence of 
sex, age, and whether the donor had evidence of an opioid use disorder. Given that the rats 
used in the study were largely a convenience sample where neurons were recovered from 
otherwise healthy adult rats to be used for other purposes, comparable analyses were not 
performed on rat neurons. We detected no influence of sex on current density which had 
a median of −51.5 pA/pF in females (n = 7) and −54.0 pA/pF in males (n = 21, p > 0.05 
Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test). Nor was there evidence of an influence of age on current 
density when donors were analyzed by those younger than 30 and older than 60, where 
the median was −47.0 in the young (n = 7) and −35.3 in the old (n = 4). Finally, there 
was no evidence of an influence of an opioid use disorder (OUD) as the density of NaV1.9 
current in those without evidence of an OUD was −47.6 pF/pF (n = 20), while that in donors 
with evidence of an OUD was −56.5 pF/pA (n = 20). We were able to assess the influence 
of ganglia (TG vs DRG) in rat, and no significant influence of ganglia was detected: The 
median current density was −107 pA/pF in TG (n = 6) and −120.4 pA/pF in DRG (n = 19).

The voltage-dependence steady-state inactivation was qualitatively similar in human (n = 
70 neurons from 15 donors) and rat (n = 78 neurons from 13 rats) sensory neurons (Figure 
2A). However, there was a significant difference between human and rat neurons in the 
V0.5 for inactivation (−44.8±1.1 mV in human vs −53±1.9mV in rat; p < 0.01) (Figure 2B). 
The variability in the V0.5 for inactivation is illustrated in the inset to Figure 2B, with data 
plotted as in Figure 1. There was a significant species difference with respect to the fraction 
of current resistant to steady-state inactivation, which was larger in human neurons (15 ± 
2.7% vs 9 ± 2.2%, p<0.05). There was also a small but significant species difference in 
the slope of steady-state inactivation curves which was 9.6 ± 0.6 and 8.1 ± 0.3 mV/e-fold 
decrease in current availability in human and rat sensory neurons, respectively (p = 0.04).

The kinetics of NaV1.9 current were evaluated with the time constants obtained by a single 
exponential equation fitted to the rising (activation), decay during sustained depolarization

(inactivation), and tail currents evoked during with voltage-steps to potentials at which 
channels were closed (deactivation) of NaV1.9 currents (Figure 3). Current evoked with 
the protocol used for the generation of I-V/G-V curves were used to determine the voltage-
dependence of the kinetics of current activation. The current evoked during the conditioning 
voltage-step in the steady-state inactivation protocol and or during the I-V curve was used 
to determine the voltage-dependence of the kinetics of current inactivation. A tail current 
protocol involving a voltage-step to −50mV to evoke NaV1.9 currents, followed by a 
voltage step to test potentials ranging from −120 to −80mV, was used to determine the 
voltage-dependence of the kinetics of deactivation.

There was no statistically significant species difference in the kinetics of current activation, 
when data were analyzed per donor or rat (Figure 3A and B) which had a time constant of 
6.8 ± 0.4 and 7.9 ± 0.6 at −50 mV in sensory neurons from human and rat, respectively. The 
variance in the kinetics of activation is illustrated in the inset to Figure 3B with data plotted 
as per the insets to Figure 1.

There was a small but significant species difference in the kinetics of inactivation which 
was faster at just about every voltage step in the rat, despite the hyperpolarizing shift in 
the voltage-dependence of current activation in human DRG neurons (Figure 3C). The 
variability in this endpoint is illustrated in the data obtained with voltage-steps to −40 mV 
because it was not possible to detect any inactivation in so many human DRG neurons at 
−50 mV over the 500 ms voltage step used in the inactivation protocol. Data in the inset to 
Figure 3C are plotted as in previous figures.

There was also a significant species difference in the kinetics of current deactivation which 
again was faster in sensory neurons from rat than human (Figure 3D). While data for the 
full tail-current protocol was only collected on neurons from three humans and three rats, 
tail currents associated with a voltage step to −120 mV following a test pulse to −50 mV 
was collected in the majority of neurons studied where the average rate of deactivation 
was 1.55 ± 0.07 ms/neurons (n = 114) and 1.56 ±0.12 per donor (n = 27) for human 
sensory neurons and 1.0 ± 0.04 ms/neuron (n = 129) and 1.01 ± 0.07 ms per rat (n = 25) 
for rat sensory neurons (Figure 3D inset). Researchers have reported slow recovery from 
inactivation for NaV1.9 in human and rodent DRG neurons [7; 11]. To examine recovery of 
NaV1.9 current from slow inactivation, NaV1.9 currents in human and rat sensory neurons 
were evoked at −50 mV from a holding potential of −120 mV at 0.2 Hz, following three 
minutes at a holding potential of −50 mV (Figure 4A). NaV1.9 currents in human DRG 
neurons recovered fully from slow inactivation over a process best fitted with a sigmoidal 
equation, with an average slope of recovery of 95.2 ± 12 s (n = 36 neurons) and a median 
recovery to 90% of max of 127 s (87 and 182 are the 25th and 75th percentiles). Interestingly, 
there appeared to be three subpopulations of neurons that could be defined by the time 
course of recovery (Figure 4B), with the majority 25 of 36, exhibiting a fast recovery 
from inactivation (recovery to 90% of max in 100 ± 5.8 s), with smaller subpopulations 
requiring with medium (200 ± 18 s to 90%, n = 6) and slow (349 ± 3.5 s to 90%, n = 
5) rates of recovery. In contrast, NaV1.9 currents in rat sensory neurons recovered over a 
process best fitted with a single exponential (Figure 4C). While not as clearly defined as 
the three subpopulations of neurons in human, there appeared to be three subpopulations

of rat sensory neurons as well that could be differentiated based on the time-course of the 
recovery from slow inactivation. In contrast to human DRG neurons, the recovery from slow 
inactivation in rat sensory neurons was best fitted with a single exponential equation (rising 
to max), with an average time constant of 245.8 ± 46 s, and a median time to 90% of 
max of 178s (117 and 257); this median time to 90% of max was significantly slower than 
that in human DRG neurons (p = 0.01, Mann Whitney Rank Sum Test). Consistent with 
this difference, NaV1.9 currents in the majority of sensory neurons from the rat (16 of 30) 
recovered slowly (287 ± 24 s to 90% of max), while others had a medium (127 ± 7.8 s to 
90%, n = 8) and fast (60.5 ± 4.2 s, n = 6) rate of recovery. The differences in the proportion 
of neurons with fast, medium, and slow rates of recovery in human and rat sensory neurons 
was significant (p < 0.01, Chi-Square).

The influence of elevated temperature on NaV1.9 currents

While NaV1.9 was originally considered to function as a subthreshold current [7], more 
recent evidence from mice suggests that at more physiological temperatures, the kinetics 
of current activation and inactivation are increased to the point that NaV1.9 contributes to 
action potential generation [40]. There is also a dramatic increase in current density at more 
physiological temperatures. To determine the extent to which NaV1.9 currents in human 
DRG neurons are comparably temperature sensitive, we assessed the impact of raising the 
bath temperature to 34°C. In some neurons, the temperature was subsequently raised to 
37°C, to rule out the possibility that the relatively small changes observed in kinetics and 
density were due to a particularly steep and narrow temperature dependence. Currents were 
studied in 21 neurons from 5 donors. Increasing the bath temperature from 20°C to 34°C 
was associated with a small but significant increase in the density of current evoked at −50 
mV (Figure 5A), from −40.7 ± 5.8 pA/pF to −56.5 ± 9.5 pA/pF, for a 42.1 ± 7.5% increase 
(Figure 5A). Importantly, the increase an increase in current density was detected in every 
neuron tested. The increase in current density was not due to a hyperpolarizing shift in the 
voltage-dependence of current activation, as is seen by the largely overlapping G-V curves 
generated from current evoked at 20°C and 34°C (Figure 5B). However, the increase in 
current density was associated with an increase in the current activation and deactivation 
rates (Figure 5C). The activation rate increased from 6.3 ± 0.5 ms to 3.0 ± 0.3 ms at −50 mV, 
for more than a 50% decrease (51.7 ± 3.7%) in the tau of current activation (p < 0.01). The 
rate of current deactivation dropped from 1.03 ± 0.06 ms to 0.54 ± 0.05 ms, for a 47 ± 3.7% 
decrease in the tau of current deactivation (p < 0.01). However, the small hyperpolarizing 
shift in current inactivation (Figure 5D), was not significant. Comparable changes were 
observed in NaV1.9 currents from rat DRG neurons (Figure 5A inset).

In the face of relatively small changes in NaV1.9 currents when the bath temperature was 
increased from 20°C to 34°C, we sought to determine whether TTX-S INa and TTX-R INa 
(i.e., NaV1.8) may be comparably resistant to temperature. TTX-S and TTX-R INa were 
isolated by changing a 500 ms prepulse potential to −100 mV from a holding potential 
of −50 mV (to inactivate NaV1.9, Figure 6A), and currents were evoked in the same 
neurons at 20oC and 34oC (Figure 6A). There were significant increases in peak TTX-R 
and TTX-S INa density from −33.0 ± 4.3 to −47.4 ± 5.9 (p < 0.01) and from −44 ± 5.3 
pA/pF to −68.4 ± 7.4 pF/pF (p < 0.01), respectively (Figure 6B). The increase in current

density was associated with an increase in the rate of current activation (Figure 6C) and 
inactivation (Figure 6D) as reflected by a decrease in the time constants (Tau) of activation 
and inactivation for both TTX-R and TTX-S INa (although there was a subpopulation of 
neurons in which the activation rate appeared to slow). While not assessed in TTX-S INa, 
the rate of deactivation was also increased for TTX-R INa (Figure 6E).

The impact of lidocaine on NaV1.9 currents in human DRG neurons

Given the importance of local anesthetics for local and regional anesthesia we next sought 
to assess the impact of the prototypical local anesthetic, lidocaine, on NaV1.9 currents in 
human DRG neurons. Seven neurons from three donors were challenged with concentrations 
of lidocaine ranging from 0.1 to 3 mM. Peak evoked current at −50 mV in the presence of 
lidocaine was analyzed as a fractional block, relative to the peak current evoked prior to the 
application of lidocaine (Figure 7A). Pooled data were fitted with a modified Hill equation 
to yield an IC50 of 0.93 mM (Figure 7B). This value is considerably higher than our previous 
estimates for the lidocaine induced block of TTX-S and TTX-R INa in rat DRG neurons, 
which were 50.2 ± 8.2 µM and 119.5 ± 25 µM, respectively [13].

Modulation of NaV1.9 currents by inflammation mediator in rat and human DRG neurons

Inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin, ATP, histamine, prostaglandin E2, and 
norepinephrine have been reported to potentiate NaV1.9 current in rodent DRG neurons 
and contribute to the hyper-excitability of nociceptors observed during inflammatory pain 
[1; 16; 27; 38]. To examine whether inflammatory mediators can potentiate NaV1.9 current 
in human DRG neurons, an inflammatory soup (IS) consisting of PGE2 (1 µM), histamine 
(1 µM), bradykinin (10 µM), and serotonin (1 µM) or control vehicle (0.1% ethanol) was 
applied to neurons while NaV1.9 current was evoked at −50 mV every 5 seconds. While 
vehicle had no effect on NaV1.9 current (n=7), IS produced a 50% decrease in current 
amplitude in 7 of 8 neurons tested (Figure 8A). Pooled G-V data from these neurons 
suggested that the decrease was due to a drop in peak conductance rather than a depolarizing 
shift in channel activation (Figure 8B). In contrast to the largely inhibitory influence of IS on 
NaV1.9 in human DRG neurons, IS resulted in an increase in NaV1.9 currents in 4 of 4 rat 
DRG neurons tested from two preparations. Vehicle had no detectable influence on NaV1.9 
currents in 6 of 6 rat DRG neurons tested (Figure 8C).

Discussion:

In the present study we compared the biophysical and pharmacological properties of NaV1.9 
in human and rat sensory neurons. Our results indicate that while the current properties 
are qualitatively similar in the two species, there are potentially important differences. 
These include the distribution of the channel among sensory neurons, current density, 
voltage-dependence of current activation, voltage-dependence of current inactivation, rates 
of current inactivation and deactivation, recovery from slow inactivation, and the impact of 
inflammatory mediators. In addition, we observed a relatively small impact of temperature 
on both human and rat NaV1.9 currents, largely associated with faster kinetics of activation 
and inactivation which were comparable in magnitude to the changes observed in human 
TTX-S and TTX-R INa currents. Finally, we observed a relatively low potency lidocaine-

induced block of NaV1.9 currents. Our results suggest that while still potentially important 
in pain, NaV1.9 channels in human DRG neurons may play a larger role in the control of 
sensory neuron excitability.

Distribution of NaV1.9

Initial reports of NaV1.9 suggested it was preferentially expressed in putative nociceptive 
sensory neurons based on its expression in small-diameter rat [10; 39] and mouse [32] TG 
and DRG neurons. RNAseq analysis confirmed that NaV1.9 is enriched in subpopulations 
of putative nociceptive human DRG neurons, but more widely expressed in multiple 
subpopulations of sensory neurons [5]. Initial electrophysiological analysis of human DRG 
neurons confirmed the presence of NaV1.9 currents in small diameter (<30 µm) neurons, 
although only small diameter neurons were studied [11]. Extending these initial observations 
we confirmed NaV1.9 currents are present in many (16 of 21) putative nociceptive afferents 
as defined by capsaicin (300 nM) sensitivity. However, in contrast to the distribution of 
mRNA encoding NaV1.9, there was little evidence that functional protein was enriched 
in small diameter human DRG neurons. There was a trend toward a significant negative 
correlation between cell body capacitance and current density (p = 0.051), but with an R2 
of 0.03. The fact that NaV1.9 currents were detected in >80% of neurons tested from each 
donor, regardless of cell body diameter suggests that NaV1.9 may play a larger role in the 
control of sensory neuron excitability. Interestingly, the density of NaV1.9 currents was 
relatively stable across donors analyzed by sex, age, or evidence of an opioid-use disorder, 
suggesting that changes in nociceptive processing observed in these different groups of 
people are not due to regulation of NaV1.9 current density.

Biophysical properties of human NaV1.9

The dramatically higher current density in rat sensory neurons would suggest the channel 
plays a more prominent role in the control of sensory neuron excitability in the rat. However, 
the more hyperpolarized G-V curve in human DRG neurons, combined with the more 
depolarized inactivation curve indicates that this current contributes to the establishment 
of resting membrane potential over a broader voltage range in human sensory neurons. 
Furthermore, the slower rates of current inactivation and deactivation suggest that the current 
contributes a depolarizing drive over longer periods, and that following an action potential, 
the current would play a larger role in driving the depolarization needed for a subsequent 
action potential. The faster rate of recovery from slow inactivation observed in most human 
DRG neurons would also facilitate the contribution of NaV1.9 to the excitability of human 
DRG neurons. Importantly, these differences would be maximized in axons and terminals, 
where differences in membrane capacitance between rat and human sensory neurons are 
not as large as at the cell soma. Thus, despite the smaller current density in human DRG 
neurons, the biophysical properties of the current in human DRG neurons suggest the 
channel may play a larger role in controlling neuronal excitability in the human than in the 
rat. Consistent with this suggestion, gain [4; 14; 18] and loss [20; 21] of function mutations 
in human NaV1.9 appear to have a far more pronounced pain phenotype than is observed in 
the complete knockout of NaV1.9 expression in mice [17; 23; 24; 28; 36].

While the only previous biophysical characterization of NaV1.9 currents in human DRG 
neurons involved a relatively limited data set, these authors did observe the hyperpolarized 
shift in the NaV1.9 G-V curve, relative to that in mouse DRG neurons [11]. The authors 
suggested that this difference in the G-V was due to differences in the amino acid sequences 
of the S4 segment [11], which could be responsible for differences in several of the other 
biophysical properties noted here.

Influence of Temperature

The observation that NaV1.9 may be particularly temperature sensitive [40] was intriguing 
for a number of reasons, including the implication that the contribution of NaV1.9 to sensory 
neuron excitability may change dramatically from the relatively cold distal appendages to 
parts of the neuron sitting at ~37°C. The greater than four-fold increase in current combined 
with the increase in the kinetics of channel activation at 37°C relative to 20°C suggested 
NaV1.9 may contribute to action potential generation [40]. Our failure to replicate these 
previous observations was not due to differences in the temperature range studied (i.e., 
34°C vs 37°C, as suggested by Figure 5). Differences in results could be due to species 
differences, given that we used human and rat neurons, while mice were used previously. 
However, the fact that we also failed to replicate the largely negative impact of temperature 
on TTX-S and more strikingly TTX-R (NaV1.8) currents previously reported [40], argues 
against this possibility. That is, in contrast to the ~40% increase in TTX-R INa density we 
observed, Touska et al reported a 12% decrease in NaV1.8 when the bath temperature was 
increased from 20°C to 30°C. This would only leave the recording conditions as a possible 
explanation, where Touska et al used 140 mM Na+ in the bath solution used to record 
Na+ currents, while we reduced the extracellular Na+ concentration to 35 mM to maintain 
clamp control over the relatively large NaV currents in rat and human sensory neurons. 
Regardless, our results suggest that NaV1.9 in humans and rats contributes minimally to 
changes in nociceptor excitability in response to changes in ambient temperature, at least 
between 20°C and 37°C, and is unlikely to contribute directly to action potential generation 
at any temperature.

Impact of lidocaine

Because a relatively small number of neurons were studied with lidocaine with a relatively 
small number of concentrations, interpretation of our lidocaine results should be made 
with caution. Nevertheless, our results are largely consistent with those obtained from 
heterologously expressed human NaV1.9 channels, where the IC50 was 356 µM [22], 
considerably higher than that for block of NaV1.7 or NaV1.8 channels. Given efficacy of 
drugs like lidocaine for regional and local anesthesia, our results suggest it is unlikely that 
NaV1.9 channels contribute to directly action potential initiation or propagation.

Dynamic modulation of NaV1.9 by inflammatory mediators

The observation that NaV1.9 currents were decreased in seven of eight neurons tested, was 
a surprise given previous results in rodent sensory neurons [1; 3; 27]. These negative results 
should be viewed with caution, given both the small number of neurons tested and the 
possibility that the increase in current may develop more slowly [38]. We may have also 
failed use the right combination and/or concentration of mediators [27]. Nevertheless, our

Conclusions

results suggest that in contrast to rodents, NaV1.9 may not contribute to acute inflammatory 
hypersensitivity. On the other hand, given a primary role for NaV1.9 in the regulation 
of resting membrane potential, and consequently, an influence on excitability secondary 
to the influence on resting membrane, the impact of a change in NaV1.9 current density 
and/or voltage-dependence of activation, will depend on the biophysical properties of the 
other ion channels present in the cell membrane. Even a decrease in NaV1.9 current 
could lead to an increase in excitability under the right conditions. Consistent with this 
possibility is the observation that while a small depolarizing shift in the voltage-dependence 
of NaV1.9 activation is associated with an increase in pain [14], an larger shift in the 
voltage-dependence of NaV1.9 activation is associated with the loss of pain [20].

Consistent with a previous description of NaV1.9 currents in human DRG neurons [11] 
several of core biophysical features of these currents, including the low threshold for 
activation and its persistence are conserved across species. However, we noted a number 
of potentially important species differences were noted. Most striking among these was 
the response to inflammatory mediators, which largely decreased currents in human DRG 
neurons, but increased currents in rat neurons. Whether this difference in current regulation 
has a differential impact on neuronal excitability, will require further experimentation. 
However, given that the net effect a change in membrane potential will have on neuronal 
excitability, and consequently pain, will depend on the biophysical properties of all the other 
ion channels in the membrane, this observation raises the possibility that more species 
differences in the density and distribution of ion channels controlling sensory neuron 
excitability have yet to be revealed. Taken together, these results highlight yet again the 
importance of the use of human tissue for the validation of potential therapeutic targets prior 
to the initiation of costly phase I trials.

Figure 1. 
Persistent low threshold sodium currents (INa) present in rat and human sensory neurons. 
A. Total tetrodotoxin (TTX) resistant voltage-gated INa was evoked in rat sensory neurons 
from a holding potential of −120 mV in the presence of 300 nM TTX (top trace). NaV1.8 
currents were isolated from total currents by changing the holding potential to ~−50 mV 
(middle traces). NaV1.9 currents were isolated by subtracting NaV1.8 currents from total 
current (bottom traces). B. A second method used to isolate NaV1.9 currents is illustrated 
in a human DRG neuron, where total TTX-resistant current (top traces) was evoked before 
the application of A-803467 (10 µM) (bottom traces). In this case, NaV1.8 could be digitally 
isolated (middle traces) by subtracting the current evoked in the presence of A-803467 from 
total current. C. Pooled I-V data collected as illustrated in A, and B, were normalized to 
membrane capacitance. Current density was significantly higher in rat than human sensory 
neurons. Inset: Current density at −50 mV from all neurons studied was also greater in rat

than human. Violin plots are of all human (open) and rat (closed) neurons studied (with 
median and 25th and 75th quartile indicated), while the overlaying dot plots are of the mean 
from each donor (tan) or rat (green). The current density was larger in rat than human 
neurons, even at −50 mV, despite the more depolarized G-V curve. D. Tail currents, or 
instantaneous G-V data were used to generate G-V curves for each neuron. Each curve 
was than fitted with a modified Boltzmann equation to estimate Gmax, the potential for 
half activation (V0.5), and the slope of the G-V curve. G-V data for each neuron was then 
normalized to the fitted Gmax prior to pooling. Inset, fitted V0.5 data for all neurons in which 
I-V/G-V data were collected, are plotted in a manner comparable to the current density data 
in C. There was a small but significant different between species with respect to the V0.5 of 
activation. In this and subsequent figures ** is p < 0.01 and * is p < 0.05, where the n used 
for comparisons was the number of rats or donors.

Relatively fast inactivation of NaV1.9 currents evoked in rat and human sensory neurons. 
A. A 500 ms conditioning pulse to potentials between −120 mV and −10 mV in 10 mV 
steps was used to assess the voltage-dependence of inactivation in rat (top traces) and human 
(bottom traces) sensory neurons. A brief (10 ms) hyperpolarizing voltage step to −120 mV 
was used to close channel prior to assessing the current evoked with a voltage step to −50 
mV. Inactivation data from each neuron were fitted with a modified Boltzmann curve to 
estimate the maximal current (Imax), the voltage of half inactivation (V0.5), the slope of the 
inactivation curve, and the fraction of non-activatable current. The difference in the fraction 
of non-inactivatable current between rat and human neurons was significant (p < 0.01), as 
was the V0.5 of inactivation, which was more hyperpolarized in rat neurons (Inset).

Figure 3. 
Kinetics of NaV1.9 current activation, inactivation, and deactivation. A. NaV1.9 current 
evoked from a rat (black trace) and a human (grey trace) sensory neuron have been scaled to 
peak current. As suggested by the current traces, rates of current activation are comparable, 
but rates of deactivation are faster in rat sensory neurons. B. The time constant, or tau, of 
current activation, is plotted as a function of test potential. Inset: Pooled inactivation data for 
current evoked at −40 mV is plotted as in Figure 1C. C. Current inactivation is significantly 
faster in rat sensory neurons. D. The time constant, or tau of current deactivation is faster 
in rat than human sensory neurons. Inset: Pooled deactivation data for current evoked at 
−50mV with a return to −120 mV, plotted as in the inset to Figure 1C. Current deactivation 
is significantly faster in rat sensory neurons.

Figure 4. 
Recovery from slow inactivation. A. Recovery from slow inactivation was monitored with a 
test pulse to −50 mV evoked at 0.2Hz after the return of the holding potential to −120 mV 
following 3 minutes at −50 mV to drive slow inactivation of NaV1.9. B. Recovery was best 
described in human sensory neurons by a sigmoidal process, where recovery in the majority 
of neurons studied was considered fast (i.e., 90% of max within 100 s), although there were 
subpopulations in which recovery was medium (i.e., 90% of max within 200 s) or slow (i.e., 
90% of max in >300 s. C. Recovery of currents in rat sensory neurons was best described 
with a single exponential, where again, there were neurons that recovered with a time course 
that would be considered fast, medium, and slow by the criteria used in human sensory 
neurons. However, the majority of neurons from rat recovered slowly from slow inactivation.

−50 mV in individual human neurons evoked at 20°C and 34°C. The increase in current 
density is significant. Inset a”: current evoked in a rat DRG neuron at −50 mV with a bath

(tau) of current activation and deactivation at 20°C and 34°C. Rates of both channel opening 
and closing were significantly increased with an increase in temperature. D. There was

Figure 6: 
Impact of temperature on TTX-S and NaV1.8 (TTX-R INa) currents in human DRG neurons. 
TTX-S and TTX-R INa were isolated in human and rat (not shown) sensory neurons with 
a voltage-protocol involving a 500 ms hyperpolarizing step to −100 mV to recover TTX-S 
currents from inactivation. A. Current evoked following the pre-pulse to −100 mV was 
considered Total current (Total INa, top traces). If the pre-pulse was changed to −50 mV, 
TTX-R INa was the only currents evoked (middle traces). TTX-S currents were isolated by 
digitally subtracting NaV1.8 current from Total INa (bottom traces). B. Peak NaV1.8 current 
(top traces) and TTX-S current (bottom traces) in a human sensory neuron evoked at 20°C 
(black trace) and 34°C (red trace). C. Increasing the bath temperature from 20°C to 34°C 
resulted in a significant increase in the peak density of both TTX-R (left panel) and TTX-S 
(right panel) INa in human sensory neurons. Increasing bath temperature from 20°C to 34°C 
also increased activation rats (D) and inactivation rates (E) for both TTX-R and TTX-S INa, 
as well as the deactivation rates for TTX-R INa (F). Comparable results were obtained for rat 
neurons (not shown).

The impact of inflammatory soup (IS) on NaV1.9 currents in human and rat sensory 
neurons. A. Persistent current was evoked at −50 mV in human sensory neurons before 
and then after an IS consisting of PGE2 (1 µM), histamine (1 µM), serotonin (1 µM), and 
bradykinin (10 µM) or vehicle. Current decreased in 7 of 8 neurons tested with IS, whereas 
no change was detected in vehicle treated neurons. An increase in current was observed in 
one of the 8 neurons tested. B. The decrease in current was associated with an apparent 
decrease in Gmax, with no changes in either the voltage-dependence of activation of the 
slope of the G-V curve. C. In rat sensory neurons, IS, but not vehicle, was associated with a 
consistent increase in current evoked at −50 mV.
