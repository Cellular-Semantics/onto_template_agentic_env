Abstract
Background: Although substance P (SP) is an important primary afferent modulator in nociceptive
processes, it is unclear whether SP regulates its own release from primary sensory neurons.

Results:  Using  a  highly  sensitive  radioimmunoassay  for  SP,  we  have  demonstrated  that  the
activation of neurokinin-1 receptor by SP or GR73632 (a potent neurokinin-1 receptor agonist)
triggered an increase of SP release from cultured adult rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons
depending  on  the  dose  and  exposure  time  within  60  min,  and  thereafter,  the  SP  release  level
gradually  decreased  over  360  min.  Accompanying  the  SP  release,  a  significant  reduction  in  the
percentage of neurons expressing neurokinin-1 receptor on their membranes during exposure to
SP  (200  pg/dish)  occurred  time  dependently  (56  ±  5%  and  32  ±  2%  at  180  and  360  min,
respectively).  The  GR73632-evoked  (10  nM,  60  min)  SP  release  was  attenuated  by  several
inhibitors for mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase
and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), protein kinase C (PKC), respectively. In contrast, a c-Jun NH2-
terminal kinase inhibitor increased the GR73632-evoked SP release.

Conclusion:  These  results  indicate  that  the  neurokinin-1  receptor  activation  by  its  agonists
regulates the SP release process involving the activation of MAP kinases, PKCs and COX-2 from
cultured DRG neurons.

Background
Substance  P  (SP)  is  one  member  of  the  tachykinin
neuropeptide  family  that  shares  a  carboxy-terminal
sequence Phe-X-Gly-Leu-Met-NH2 [1], along with neuroki-
nin A, neurokinin B and neuropeptide K, neuropeptide-γ.
SP is derived from the preprotachykinin-A gene, and is syn-
thesized  in  the  dorsal  root  ganglion  (DRG)  neurons  [2].
SP is  released  through  a  very  complex  process  involving

some important intracellular effectors, such as extracellular
calcium  influx,  1,4,5-inositol  trisphosphate-induced  cal-
cium release, the activation of extracellular signal-regulated
kinase  (ERK),  cyclooxygenases  (COXs)  and  prostagland-
ins, and the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA)
from  primary  afferent  neurons  to  convey information
about various noxious stimuli [3-6]. Previous studies have

neurotransmitter and/or, as a primary afferent modulator
in  nociceptive  processes,  thereby  potentiating  excitatory
input to nociceptive neurons [7-10].

The biological effects of SP are mediated through binding
to  the  specific  G-protein-coupled  neurokinin  receptors
designated neurokinin-1, -2 and -3 receptors [11]. Once
activated by SP, the neurokinin receptor induces the acti-
vation of several second messenger systems, such as phos-
pholipase  C  (PLC)  and  adenylate  cyclase,  thereby
increasing the consequent production of 1,4,5-inositol tri-
sphosphate and cyclic AMP [12]. Moreover SP has been
shown  to  induce  the  activation  of  ERK1/2  and  p38
mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, nuclear factor-
kappa  B  and  protein  kinase  C  (PKC),  and  thereafter  to
increase  the  production  of  prostaglandin  E2  and  the
expression of COX-2 [13-15]. Interestingly, both anatom-
ical and functional evidence have also suggested that neu-
rokinin-1  receptors  may  function  as  auto-receptors  in
DRG  neurons  [16,17].  In  view  of  the  above-mentioned
observations  on  the  release  and  the  biological  effects  of
SP,  it  is  considered  important  to  clarify  whether  the
release of SP is induced via the activation of neurokinin-1
receptor, while also elucidating what type of signaling can
occur  in  the  process  of  SP  release  via  the  neurokinin-1
receptor from cultured adult rat DRG neurons. Hence, the
objective of the present study is designed to demonstrate
whether  the  release  of  SP  may  be  stimulated  by  itself
through  the  activation  of  its  receptors  and  the  involve-
ment  of  some  important  intracellular  effectors  (such  as
MAP kinase, PLC and PKC, COX and PKA) from cultured
DRG neurons.

Results
The release of SP induced by itself from cultured rat DRG 
neurons
To  investigate  whether  SP  induces  its  own  release  from
cultured DRG neurons, we examined the effects of SP on
the release of SP in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
Based on the amount of the SP release induced by various
chemicals in our previous study [5,6,18], we selected 200
pg/dish  of  SP  as  an  appropriate  concentration  for  our
experimental  conditions  for  investigating  the  possibility
of  self-induced  SP  release.  A  time-course  of  SP  release
induced by SP (200 pg/dish) from cultured DRG neurons
is shown in Fig. 1A. As a peak of SP release was observed
after the 60 min incubation, we decided to use the 60 min
incubation with SP (200 pg/dish) as an experimental con-
dition for examining various drugs on the self-induced SP
release. As shown in Fig. 1B, SP evoked a dose-dependent
release of SP during a 60 min incubation of cultured DRG
neurons.

It  is  well  known  that  all  three  neurokinin  receptors
(neurokinin-1, -2 and -3 receptors) are expressed in DRG

neurons. We therefore investigated whether neurokinin-1
and/or  other  neurokinin  receptor(s)  are  involved  in  the
SP release induced by itself. The increase in the SP release
evoked by itself was partially significantly attenuated by 1
μM  CP-96,345  (a  selective  antagonist  of  neurokinin-1
receptor) [19] and by 100 nM GR94800 (a selective antag-
onist  of  neurokinin-2  receptor)  [20],  not  by  1  μM
SB222200 (a selective antagonist of neurokinin-3 recep-
tor) [20] as shown in Fig. 1C, whereas these antagonists
did  not  have  any  effect  when  used  alone  (Data  not

shown). Based on the results shown in Fig. 1C, both the
neurokinin-1 and -2 receptors seem to be involved in the
process of SP release, however, the detailed pharmacolog-
ical  action(s)  of  the  neurokinin-2  receptor  in  the  sub-
stance P release will be examined in future experiments.

Immunocytochemical localization of the neurokinin-1 
receptor and SP
We next investigated the time-dependent changes in the
expression of SP and its neurokinin-1 receptor in cultured
DRG  cells  incubated  in  serum-free  DMEM  (containing
peptidase inhibitors) with or without SP (200 pg/dish) in
the  presence/absence  of  1  μM  CP-96,345.  The  specific
type of cells indicated by arrows in Figs 2A and 2B can eas-
ily be identified to be DRG neurons by the morphology
(characteristic phase bright cell bodies bearing either bi-
or  multi-polar  neurites  observed  by  using  the  Olympus
IX71 inverted microscope with a 20X Ph1 objective) and
by the Schwann cell marker S100 (Rabbit anti-cow S100;
1:1,000  dilution;  Dako,  Glostrup,  Denmark)-  and  the
fibrillary
astrocyte  marker  GFAP  (Mouse  anti-glial 
acidic protein; 1:800 dilution; Chemicon, Temecula, CA)-
negative  expression  (Data  not  shown).  As  shown  in
Figs 2Ai–iv,  the  neurokinin-1  receptors  were  distributed
on the membrane and in the cytoplasm of smaller DRG
neurons in a naive state. The ratio of the number of neu-
rons expressing the neurokinin-1 receptor on their mem-
branes  to  the  total  number  of  neurokinin-1  receptor-
positive  neurons  in  a  randomly  selected  field  in  each
image  from  three  separate  experiments  was  simultane-
ously  calculated.  The  percentage  of  neurons  expressing
neurokinin-1 receptor on their membrane in a naive state
was 91 ± 5%, 82 ± 4% and 74 ± 4%, 71 ± 3% in Figs 2Ai–
iv, respectively. Interestingly, a significant reduction in the
percentage  of  neurons  expressing  neurokinin-1  receptor
on their membranes was observed after the time-depend-
ent stimulation of 200 pg/dish SP (85 ± 4%, 71 ± 7% and
56 ± 5%, 32 ± 2% in Figs 2Av–viii, respectively) in com-
parison to their respective controls (p > 0.05, p > 0.05 and
p < 0.05, p < 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, the reduc-
tion  induced  by  SP  was  attenuated  by  the  pretreatment
(10 min) with 1 μM CP-96,345 (86 ± 4%, 85 ± 7% and 84
± 2%, 84 ± 5% in Figs 2Aix–xii, respectively). On the other
hand, we observed the SP content to be mainly distributed
in the cytoplasm of the smaller DRG neurons (Fig. 2B).
The long-term (60 to 360 min) exposure of the DRG neu-
rons to SP (200 pg/dish) thus resulted in a reduction of
the SP content in their cytoplasm (Figs 2Bv–viii), whereas
the pretreatment with 1 μM CP-96,345 blocked the reduc-
tion  of  the  SP  content  (Figs  2Bix–xii).  The  SP-evoked
expression change of the neurokinin-1 receptor from the
membrane to the intracellular compartment in somas of
DRG neurons should therefore be considered as the recep-
tor internalization (a pharmacologically specific index of
neurokinin-1 receptor-SP interaction).

The SP-induced changes of neurokinin-1 receptor 
expression in the cytosolic and membrane fractions
Based  on  the  neurokinin-1  receptor  localization  results
shown in Fig. 2A, we attempted to further quantify the lev-
els  of  neurokinin-1  receptor  in  the  cytosolic  and  mem-
brane  fractions  of  cultured  DRG  neurons.  As  shown  in

Figs  3A  and  3B,  the  time-dependent  (10–360  min)
exposure  of  cultured  DRG  neurons  to  SP  (200  pg/dish)
resulted  in  a  significant  decrease  of  the  neurokinin-1
receptor  expression  in  the  membrane  fractions  (104  ±
15%, 74 ± 4% and 42 ± 5%, 14 ± 1% in Figs 3A and 3B,
respectively, compared with the control at 10 min). The
SP-induced  decrease  of  that  was  completely  blocked  by
the 10 min pretreatment with 1 μM CP-96,345 (102 ± 9%,
100 ± 7% and  74  ± 11%, 61 ±  14%  in  Figs 3A and 3B,
respectively, compared with the control at 10 min). There-
fore  the  activation  of  neurokinin-1  receptor  by  SP  is
accompanied by the internalization of its receptors, how-
ever, we could not identify the proteins detected by anti-
substance  P  receptor  antibody  in  the  cytosol  as  a  func-
tional neurokinin-1 receptor. Interestingly, we observed a
gradual decrease of the neurokinin-1 receptor expression
in the membrane fraction from the untreated DRG neu-
rons (the control). These data suggest the endogenous SP
released from the DRG neurons could enhance the turno-
ver of neurokinin-1 receptor from the membrane to the
cytosol as the released SP is not taken into the DRG cells.
However,  after  the  induction  of  internalization  by  the
stimulation  of  SP,  the  level  of  the  cytosolic  proteins
detected by anti-substance P receptor antibody does not
change, thus suggesting a part of internalized neurokinin-
1  receptor  protein  could  be  degraded  to  maintain  the
amount  of  neurokinin-1  receptor  to  some  extent within
the cytosol.

Characteristics of the GR73632-induced release of SP
The data shown in Figs 1C and 2 indicate that the activa-
tion of neurokinin-1 receptor is involved in the SP release
induced by SP. We therefore selected another potent neu-
rokinin-1  receptor  agonist  GR73632  (showing  no  cross-
reactivity with anti-SP serum in radioimmunoassay) to fur-
ther  investigate  the  molecular  mechanisms  of  the  SP
release via the activation of the neurokinin-1 receptor in
cultured  DRG  neurons.  As  shown  in  Fig.  4A,  it  was
observed that a 60 min incubation with GR73632 (1–100
nM) stimulated a significant increase in the SP release in a
dose-dependent manner from the cultured DRG neurons.
The increases in the SP release induced by GR73632 at var-
ious  concentrations  were  almost  completely  blocked  by
the  10  min  pretreatment  with  CP-96,345.  Based  on  the
results shown in Fig. 4B, we thought that the 60 min incu-
bation  with  10  nM  GR73632  was  an  appropriate  condi-
tion  in  our  experiments.  However,  we  observed  that  a
time-dependent treatment (10 min to 24 h) of GR73632
(10 nM) did not cause any detectable change in the total
amount of SP content from cultured DRG neurons and the
culture medium (Fig. 4C). In addition, significant changes
of the preprotachykinin mRNA expression were not caused
by the time-dependent (10–360 min) exposure of cultured
DRG  neurons  to  10  nM  GR73632  (Data  not  shown).
Therefore, the effect of GR73632 under our experimental

conditions  should  not  be  considered  to  cause  a  rapid
increase in the synthesis of the SP content in cultured DRG
neurons.

Whether  the  complex  process  of  SP  release  induced  by
GR73632 requires the activation of MAP kinases, COXs,
PLC or PKCs, PKA in cultured DRG neurons, still remains

to  be  elucidated.  As  shown  in  Fig. 5A,  both  U0126  and
SB203580 exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on the
SP release evoked by GR73632, whereas SP600125 stimu-
lated  an  increase  in  the  SP  release.  When  these  three
inhibitors [6] of MAP kinases were used alone, only a c-
Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125 had a
weak tendency to increase the SP release (Fig. 5A). We also
observed  that  the  GR73632-induced  SP  release  (Figs  5B

and 5D) was significantly attenuated by NS-398 (a highly
selective inhibitor of COX-2) [5], indomethacin (a non-

tion inhibitor peptide [21], Gö6976 (a selective inhibitor
for PKCα-, βI-isozymes) [22] or bisindolylmaleimide I (a
broad  inhibitor  for  PKCα-,  βI-,  βII-,  γ-,  δ-,  ε-isozymes)
[22].  However,  neither  U73122  (a  selective  inhibitor  of
PLC) [23] nor H89 (a selective inhibitor of PKA) [4] influ-
enced the SP release induced by GR73632 (Figs  5C and
5D).

Up-regulation of COX-2 expression induced by SP and by 
GR73632
To  clarify  the  possible  signal  transduction  pathway(s)
involved in the SP release via the activation of neurokinin-
1  receptor,  the  activation  status  of  COX-2  was  assessed
using specific antibodies for COX-2 after the stimulation
of SP or GR73632 in the absence or presence of various
inhibitors. The time-dependent exposure of DRG neurons
to SP (200 pg/dish) resulted in the significant increase of
de novo protein synthesis of COX-2 (Fig. 6A). The 60 min
incubation  with  10  nM  GR73632  also  up-regulated  the
expression  of  COX-2  protein  (Fig.  6B),  whereas  the
increase  in  the  expression  of  COX-2  protein  evoked  by
GR73632 was significantly attenuated by the pretreatment
with  CP-96,345,  U0126,  NS-398  or  three  inhibitors  for
PKC isozymes (Gö6976, bisindolylmaleimide I and PKCε
translocation  inhibitor  peptide),  respectively.  However,
neither SB203580 nor SP600125 influenced the up-regu-
lation of COX-2 expression induced by GR73632.

Discussion
In  the  present  study,  we  demonstrated  for  the  first  time
that the activation of neurokinin-1 receptor by its agonists
(SP or GR73632) modulates the SP release from cultured
DRG  neurons  through  some  important  intracellular
effectors.

During the 360 min exposure of DRG to SP (200 pg/dish),
a peak response in the SP release was observed within the
first 60 min, whereas a gradual decrease in the SP release
level was obtained at later time points (180 and 360 min)
(Fig. 1A). The release pattern of SP induced by itself may
be  explained  by  the  internalization  and  recycling  of  the
neurokinin-1  receptor  [24],  because  the  immunocyto-
chemical  and  Western  blotting  results  (Figs  2A  and  3)
showed the existence of neurokinin-1 receptor internali-
zation induced by SP, and it also indicated an inhibitory
effect of the continuous exposure to SP on the neurokinin-
1  receptor  recycling.  In  addition,  the  time-dependent
reduction in SP content of the DRG neurons exposed to SP
provides  an  explanation  for  the  existence  of  SP  release
(Fig. 2B). Our present findings are therefore in agreement
with  the  hypothesis  that  SP  induces  its  own  release  via
its auto-receptor, the neurokinin-1 receptor [16,17]. Our

indicated 

that  SP  may 

data  also 
function  as  a
neuromodulator in the slow release response itself from
cultured  DRG  neurons.  The  precise  mechanism  of  the
association between the SP release and the neurokinin-1
receptor  internalization  should  be  revealed  by  further
studies.

The neurokinin-1 receptor has a preferential affinity for SP
[25].  The  expression  of  the  neurokinin-1  receptor  is
observed mainly in the small rat DRG neurons by in situ
hybridization [26]. We have therefore focused our atten-
tion on the involvement of the neurokinin-1 receptor in
the SP release from cultured DRG neurons. GR73632 (a
selective agonist of the neurokinin-1 receptor) stimulated
a significant increase in the release of SP via acting on the
neurokinin-1 receptor. To clarify the characteristics of SP
release via the neurokinin-1 receptor, we further investi-
gated  the  possible  involvement  of  several  intracellular
effectors, such as MAPKs, COX-2 and PLC, PKA and PKCs.

The MAPKs family contains at least three protein kinases
in series: JNK, p38 MAP kinase and MEK (a kinase imme-
diately upstream of ERK that phosphorylates the tyrosine
and  threonine  residues  on  ERK1/2  required  for  activa-
tion).  They  are  often  involved  in  the  intracellular  trans-
mission  of  extracellular  signals  [27].  In  our  previous
study, the activation of ERK1/2 was demonstrated to be
involved in the SP release evoked by bradykinin [6]. Fie-
bich  et  al.  [13]  and  Yang  et  al.  [28]  also  indicated  that
ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase can be rapidly activated by
SP  in  a  dose-dependent  manner.  In  view  of  the  above-
mentioned observations and the results shown in Fig. 5A,
p38 MAP kinase and MEK seem to play a role in increasing
the release of SP. In contrast, the data shown in Fig. 5A
suggest that the JNK is likely to be associated with the sup-
pression  of  SP  release  from  cultured  DRG  neurons,
although  this  kinase  was  reported  to  function  as  an
important factor involved in SP-stimulated secretion and
production  of  inflammatory  mediators  in  rat  peritoneal
mast cells [29].

It is well known that the binding of the ligand to the neu-
rokinin-1 receptor activates several second messenger sys-
tems,  including  1,4,5-inositol  trisphosphate  formation
via PLC activation and cyclic AMP accumulation via ade-
nylate cyclase [12]. The activation of cyclic AMP-depend-
ent PKA was also reported to be involved in the SP release
caused  by  prostaglandin  E2[30].  However,  we  observed
that PLC and PKA did not influence the SP release via the
neurokinin-1 receptor from cultured DRG neurons.

PKC is a family of serine- and threonine-specific protein
kinases,  which  has  been  suggested  to  function  as  an
important  intracellular  signaling  molecule  in  primary
afferent nociceptors, while also being implicated in acute

and  chronic  inflammatory  as  well  as  neuropathic  pain.
The  activation  of  PKC  was  also  reported  to  induce  the
synthesis of COX-2 and the release of prostaglandin E2 in
primary  midbrain  astrocytes  [31].  Previous  study  in  our
laboratory [32] has shown that the time-dependent and
transient induction of COX-2 mRNA was observed 30 min
after  bradykinin  (a  potent  pro-inflammatory  mediator)
stimulation  in  cultured  DRG  neurons.  The  short-term
exposure of the DRG neurons to bradykinin at 1 μM for 30
min also induced small but significant amounts of pros-
taglandin  E2  release  depending  on  the  activation  of
COX1/2. Our present findings also demonstrated a signif-
icant increase in COX-2 expression stimulated during a 60
min exposure of cultured DRG neurons to SP (Fig. 6A).
Moreover,  the  de  novo  protein  synthesis  of  COX-2
requires the activation of PKCs and MEK (Fig. 6B). In view
of the above-mentioned observations and results shown
in Figs 5D and 6, it is suggested that PKC isozymes includ-
ing ε type play the important roles in the de novo protein
synthesis  of  COX-2  via  the  neurokinin-1  receptor,  and
thereby  increase  the  SP  release  from  cultured  DRG
neurons.

Interestingly, our results in the present work are partially
consistent with several previous observations in vivo. For
example,  the  activation  of  neurokinin-1  receptors  by
intrathecal  injection  of  SP  evokes  thermal  hyperalgesia
and spinal prostaglandin E2 release which can be reversed
by spinal COX-2 inhibition and by the intrathecal delivery
of the  p38  MAP  kinase  inhibitor SB203580; spinal PKC
inhibition blocks the intrathecal injection of SP-mediated
thermal hyperalgesia [34-37]. Moreover, the inhibition of
PLC-β and PKC-ε can completely block both the neuroki-
nin-1 receptor agonist-induced TRPV1 (transient receptor
potential  vanilloid  subtype  1)  potentiation  and  heat
hyperalgesia [38]. Similar to the observation reported by
Zhang et al. [38], we also observed that the activation of
neurokinin-1 receptor by its agonist GR73632 to enhance
the  capsaicin-evoked  substance  P  release  in  our  latest
research, which thus demonstrated that the potentiation
of capsaicin-evoked substance P release by GR73632 via
the  activation  of  neurokinin-1  receptor  depends  on  the
activation of PKCs, MEK and p38 MAP kinase, PLC and
COXs  from  cultured  DRG  neurons  (Unpublished  data).
However, the detailed relationships among the activation
of  PLC,  PKC,  MAP  kinases  and  COXs  regarding  the
enhancement of capsaicin-evoked substance P release by
GR73632 via the activation of neurokinin-1 receptor will
be described in a study to be published in the not-so-dis-
tant  future.  Based  on  our  findings  and  the  above-men-
tioned  observations  reported  previously,  we  proposed  a
possible molecular mechanism underlying the SP release
induced  by  the  neurokinin-1  receptor  agonists  (SP  and
GR73632) from cultured rat DRG neurons. The long-term
exposure of DRG neurons to SP or GR73632 resulted in

nin-1 receptor by its agonists (SP and GR73632) regulates
the  SP  release  process  depending  on  the  activation  of

MEK, p38 MAP kinase and PKC, and the de novo protein
synthesis  of  COX-2,  while  also  indicating  that  the  JNK
likely  has  an  inhibitory  effect  on  the  SP  release.  These
observations  provide  important  evidence  to  help  us
understand  the  molecular  mechanisms  of  inflammatory
pain modulated by SP in primary afferent neurons.

Methods
Isolation and culture of rat DRG cells
According  to  a  previously  described  method  [5,6,23],
DRGs of young adult Wistar rats (6–9 weeks of age) were
dissociated into  single  isolated  neurons and  non-neuro-
nal cells by the treatment of collagenase (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA) and trypsin (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Can-
ada). The cells (3 DRGs/dish) were maintained at 37°C in
a  water-saturated  atmosphere  with  5%  CO2  for  5  days
before the initiation of the experiments. All procedures for
animal  experiments  were  performed  according  to  the
Guide  for  Animal  Experimentation,  Hiroshima  Univer-
sity, and the Committee of Research Facilities for Labora-
tory  Animal  Sciences,  Graduate  School  of  Biomedical
Sciences, Hiroshima University, Japan.

Measurement of SP content in the culture medium and in 
the cultured rat DRG neurons
Except for some cultured cells treated by peptidase inhib-
itors containing 1 μM phosphoramidon (Sigma), 4 μg/ml
bacitracin (Sigma) and 1 μM captopril (Sigma) alone (as
a control), other cultured cells were exposed to SP (Pep-
tide  Institute,  Osaka,  Japan)  or  to  GR73632  (Sigma),
either  alone  or  together  with  various  inhibitors  such  as
Gö6976 (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany), PKCε trans-
location inhibitor peptide (Calbiochem) and bisindolyl-
maleimide  I  (Calbiochem),  indomethacin  (Sigma)  and
SB222200  (Sigma),  GR94800  (Sigma)  and  U73122
(Sigma), SP600125 (Sigma) and H89 (Seikagaku, Tokyo,
Japan) in 1 ml serum-free DMEM (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan)
containing peptidase inhibitors for a designated period of
time  at  37°C  in  a  water-saturated  atmosphere  with  5%
CO2. Thereafter, the SP content collected from the culture
medium and the cultured DRG neurons was measured by
a highly sensitive radioimmunoassay [5,18], respectively.
For examining the amount of SP-induced SP release in the
present experiments, we developed a new computational
method. Briefly, SP at a specified concentration (100, 200
and 800, 1,000 pg/dish) was used to stimulate two groups
of cultured DRG neurons in both the absence and pres-
ence of various antagonists for three neurokinin receptors
(neurokinin-1, -2 and -3 receptors). The SP content was
immediately  collected  from  the  culture  medium  (1  ml)
after  the  SP  stimulation  for  the  first  group,  and  the
amount  of  SP  content  was  examined  from  the  culture
medium (1 ml) after the SP stimulation lasted for 10, 60,
180, 360 minutes, respectively, for the second group. The
numerical  difference  in  the SP  content  between  the  two

groups  is  considered  to  be  the  amount  of  SP  release
induced  by  this  specified  concentration  of  SP  during  a
specific  time  period  from  cultured  DRG  neurons.

Immunocytochemical staining for the neurokinin-1 
receptor and SP in the cultured rat DRG neurons
Immunocytochemical  staining  for  the  neurokinin-1
receptor and SP in cultured DRG neurons on coverglasses
was performed with a standard immunoperoxidase tech-
nique [Histofine Simple Stain Rat MAX-PO (MULTI) kit;
Nichirei,  Tokyo,  Japan]  according  to  the  manufacturer's
instructions. Briefly, 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed cultured
DRG cells on coverglasses were incubated with anti-neu-
rokinin-1  receptor  (1:2,000  dilution;  Sigma)  or  anti-SP
serum (1:1,000 dilution; a gift of Dr. J.S. Hong, National
Institute  of  Environmental  Health  Sciences,  NIH,  USA)
[33].  After  the  treatment  with  Histofine  simple  stain  rat
MAX-PO (MULTI), color development (brown) was per-
formed using a DAB substrate kit (Nichirei), and the cov-
erglasses  were  counterstained  with  hematoxylin  (blue).
According  to  the  manufacturer's  instructions  for  the
datasheet  of  anti-substance  P  receptor  antibody  (S8305,
Sigma), it is guaranteed that the antibody specifically rec-
ognizes  the  neurokinin-1  receptor  peptide  (rat,  amino
acids 393–407) in immunoblotting. Immunocytochemi-
cal  controls  demonstrating  antibody  specificity  for  the
neurokinin-1 receptor and SP included immunostaining
cultured  cells  on  coverglasses,  but  the  primary  antibody
was  omitted.  The  omission  of  the  primary  antibody
resulted in no staining in the cells.

Subcellular fractionation
After a 10 min pretreatment with the presence or absence
of  1  μM  CP-96,345  (Pfizer,  Groton,  CT,  USA),  the  cul-
tured  DRG  cells  were  incubated  in  serum-free  DMEM
(containing peptidase inhibitors) with or without SP (200
pg/dish) for 10, 60, 180, 360 minutes, respectively. The
isolation of cytosolic and membrane fractions from these
DRG  cells  was  performed  with  a  standard  cell  compart-
ment kit fractionation procedure (Cell compartment kit;
Qiagen,  Tokyo,  Japan)  according  to  the  manufacturer's
instructions.  Protein  concentrations  were  determined,
and  then  the  neurokinin-1  receptor  levels  in  the  same
amounts of cytosolic and membrane proteins were ana-
lyzed separately by a Western blot analysis.

Western blot analysis
At the end of the SP release experiments, the cell samples
were  processed  for  Western  blot  analysis  as  previously
described  [6].  Primary  antibodies  were  raised  against
COX-2  (1:1,000  dilution;  COX-2  polyclonal  antibody;
Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), β-actin (1:5,000 dilu-
tion; the mouse monoclonal antibody for β-actin; Sigma)
or  anti-substance  P  receptor  (1:2,000  dilution;  Sigma).
The  horseradish  peroxidase-conjugated  anti-rabbit  and

chemiluminescence detection according to the manufac-
turer's instructions, respectively.
