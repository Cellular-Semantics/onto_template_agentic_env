Abstract Voltage-gated sodium channels (Navs) play an
important role in human pain sensation. However,
the
expression and role of Nav subtypes in native human
sensory neurons are unclear. To address this issue, we
obtained human dorsal root ganglion (hDRG) tissues from
healthy donors. PCR analysis of seven DRG-expressed Nav
subtypes revealed that the hDRG has higher expression of
Nav1.7 (*50% of total Nav expression) and lower expres-
sion of Nav1.8 (*12%), whereas the mouse DRG has
higher expression of Nav1.8 (*45%) and lower expression
of Nav1.7 (*18%). To mimic Nav regulation in chronic
pain, we treated hDRG neurons in primary cultures with
paclitaxel (0.1–1 lmol/L) for 24 h. Paclitaxel increased the
Nav1.7 but not Nav1.8 expression and also increased the

Introduction

Over the last 20 years, great progress has been made in
identifying novel pain targets and illustrating the neuronal,
immune, and glial mechanisms of pathological pain in
animal models [1–4]. Despite the progress in preclinical
studies and substantial investment by the pharmaceutical
industry, little progress has been made in developing novel,
efﬁcacious, and safe analgesics for human pain conditions
[5, 6]. A translational gap from rodents to humans has been
blamed for the failure in developing pain medications
[5, 6]. To address this issue, several groups including our
own have begun to investigate pain mechanisms in native
primary sensory neurons in human dorsal root ganglia
(hDRGs) obtained from donors [7–11]. Davidson et al.
demonstrated that a high proportion of hDRG neurons
respond to the algogens allyl isothiocyanate and ATP, as
well as the pruritogens histamine and chloroquine [7].
Importantly, hDRG neurons also respond to the inﬂamma-
tory mediators bradykinin and prostaglandin E2, showing
evidence of peripheral sensitization [7].

Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels play a critical role
in the initiation and propagation of action potentials in
excitable cells such as neurons and are the major targets of
analgesics
[12–14]. Nine subtypes of Nav (Nav1.1–
Nav1.9) have been identiﬁed; each subtype plays a distinct

physiological role and also exhibits distinct expression
patterns in DRG neurons. For example, Nav1.7–Nav1.9 are
mainly expressed in small nociceptive neurons in DRGs
[12, 15–19]. In particular, recent genetic studies have
demonstrated a critical role of Nav1.7 in pain sensation in
humans. Loss-of-function mutations in SCN9A, the gene
that codes for Nav1.7 in humans, result in a congenital
inability to sense pain and anosmia without affecting other
sensations such as touch and temperature [20, 21]. Con-
versely, gain-of-function mutations lead to episodic pain
such as primary erythromelalgia and paroxysmal extreme
pain disorder [22, 23]. Despite an essential role of Navs in
human pain regulation, little is known about their expres-
sion and function in native human sensory neurons.
Recently, Han et al. showed that human Nav1.8 channels
display slower inactivation kinetics and produce larger
persistent current and ramp current
than previously
reported in other species [8]. In this study, we set out to
compare the relative expression levels of different Nav
subtypes in mouse DRG (mDRG) and hDRG tissues. We
found that hDRG has a high ratio of Nav1.7 expression and
low ratio of Nav1.8 expression compared to mDRG. To
recapitulate chronic pain-induced changes
in sodium
channel expression, we treated dissociated hDRG neurons
with paclitaxel, a chemotherapy agent that induces neuro-
pathic pain [10]. Our data demonstrated that paclitaxel not
only increased the expression of Nav1.7 but also enhanced
the function of Nav1.7, as revealed by enlarged amplitude
of sodium currents and increased ﬁring frequency of action
potentials, in human nociceptive neurons.

Materials and Methods

Reagents

Paclitaxel was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
Speciﬁc primers were designed using the Real-Time PCR
web tool from IDT SciTools (Integrated DNA Technolo-
gies, Coralville, IA).

Animals

Adult CD1 mice (8–10 weeks old, both sexes) were
obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington,
MA) and used for PCR analysis. All the animal procedures
performed in this study were approved by the Animal Care
Committee of Duke University Medical Centre.

Human DRG Tissues

Human DRGs were obtained from healthy donors through
the National Disease Research Interchange (Philadelphia,

PA) with permission from the Duke University Institutional
Review Board. Postmortem L3–L5 DRGs were dissected
from donors (see Table 1 for further details) and delivered
in ice-cold culture medium to the laboratory at Duke
University within 24–72 h of the donor’s death.

Immunohistochemistry

Human DRGs were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde over-
night and then sections (12 lm) were cut on a cryostat. The
sections were ﬁrst blocked with 2% BSA for 1 h at room
temperature, then incubated with peripherin (1:500, rabbit,
Sigma) or a mixture of primary polyclonal TRPV1
rabbit, Neuromics, Edina, MN) and
antibody (1:400,
monoclonal NF200H antibody (1:1000, mouse, Sigma)
overnight at 4 (cid:3)C. The sections were then incubated for 2 h
at room temperature with cyanine 3 (Cy3)- and FITC-
Jackson
conjugated
ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). The DRG sections
were then stained with DAPI (1:1000, Sigma, for 5 min)
and examined under a Nikon ﬂuorescence microscope.
Images were captured with a CCD Spot camera and
analyzed with NIH Image J software or Adobe PhotoShop.

transcribed using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit
according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Qiagen).
The sequences of human Nav primers are listed in Table 2
(the sequences of mouse Nav primers were obtained from a
previous publication [24]). We performed gene-speciﬁc
mRNA analyses using the Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time RT-
PCR system (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Quantitative PCR
ampliﬁcation reactions contained the same amount of
reverse transcription product: 7.5 lL of Kapa Sybr(cid:4) Fast
Bio-Rad iCycler 2X qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems,
Wilmington, MA) and 200 nmol/L forward and reverse
primers in a ﬁnal volume of 15 lL. The thermal cycling
conditions were: 3 min of polymerase activation at 95 (cid:3)C,
45 cycles of denaturation at 95 (cid:3)C for 10 s, and annealing
and extension at 60 (cid:3)C for 30 s, followed by a DNA
melting curve for the determination of amplicon speci-
ﬁcity. The expression level of the target mRNA was
normalized to that of GAPDH mRNA and analyzed using
the standard 2-DDCT method. The relative mRNA expres-
sion of each Nav subtype is shown as a percentage of the
total Navs (all seven subtypes) tested in DRGs [24].

Human DRG Neuron Cultures

II

Upon delivery, DRGs were rapidly dissected from the
nerve roots, minced in Ca2?-free Hank’s balanced salt
solution (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), and cultures were
prepared as previously reported [11]. DRGs were digested
at 37 (cid:3)C in a humidiﬁed CO2 incubator for 120 min with
collagenase Type
(Worthington, Lakewood, NJ;
290 units/mg, 12 mg/mL ﬁnal concentration) and dispase
II (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; 1 unit/mg, 20 mg/mL) in
phosphate-buffered saline with 10 mmol/L HEPES, pH
adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. hDRGs were mechanically
dissociated using ﬁre-polished pipettes, ﬁltered through a
100-lm nylon mesh, and centrifuged for 5 min (500 g).
The DRG cell pellet was re-suspended and plated on
0.5 mg/mL poly-D-lysine-coated glass coverslips. The
DRG cultures were grown in Neurobasal medium

123

supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2% B-27
supplement, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.

Whole-Cell Patch-Clamp Recordings in Dissociated
Human DRG Neurons

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings
in small-diameter
(\50 lm) hDRG neurons were conducted at room tem-
perature. We used patch pipettes to record transient Na?
currents and action potentials with an EPC10 ampliﬁer
(HEKA, Holliston, MA) and an Axopatch-200B ampliﬁer
with a Digidata 1440A (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale CA).
The patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate capillaries
(World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL). The
resistance was 3–4 MX when ﬁlled with pipette solution.
The recording chamber (300 lL) was continuously super-
fused at 3–4 mL/min. Series resistance was compensated
([80%) and leak subtraction was performed. Data were
low-pass-ﬁltered at 2 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. Patch-
master (HEKA) and pClamp10 (Axon Instruments) soft-
wares were used during experiments and analysis. For
recording Na? currents, the pipette solution contained (in
mmol/L): CsCl 130, NaCl 9, MgCl2 1, EGTA 10, HEPES
10, adjusted to pH 7.3 with CsOH. For action potential
recordings, the pipette solution contained (in mmol/L):
K-gluconate 136, NaCl 10, MgCl2 1, EGTA 10, HEPES 10,
Mg-ATP 2, adjusted to pH 7.3 with KOH. According to our
preliminary study in hDRG neurons, action potentials were
induced by 500 pA current injection for 1 s. The external
solution for action potential recordings was composed of
(in mmol/L): NaCl 140, KCl 5, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, HEPES
10, glucose 10, adjusted to pH 7.3 with NaOH. The
external solution for recording transient Na? currents
contained (in mmol/L): NaCl 131, TEACl 10, CsCl 10,
CaCl2 1, MgCl2 2, CdCl2 0.3, 4-aminopyridine 3, HEPES
10, glucose 10, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. In voltage-
clamp experiments, transient Na? currents were evoked by
a test pulse to 0 mV from the holding potential (-70 mV).

Statistical Analysis

All data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Biochemical and
electrophysiological data were tested using one-way or two-
way ANOVA followed by the post-hoc Bonferroni test or
unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test. Pearson’s correlation was
used to test the linear dependence of two variables. Statistical
analyses were performed with Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software)
and the criterion for statistical signiﬁcance was P \ 0.05.

Results

Immunohistochemical Characterization of Human
DRG Neurons

Immunoﬂuorescent staining of hDRGs is a challenge,
because of the high background of autoﬂuorescence in

and small neurons

human tissue [25]. We were able to obtain intact frozen
sections of hDRGs, as demonstrated by DAPI staining,
which shows all the nuclei in sections (Fig. 1A). Notably,
hDRG neurons were much larger
than rodent DRG
neurons, and small hDRG neurons were identiﬁed with
diameters of \50 lm [7, 11]. Neuroﬁlament (NF200) is a
marker for myelinated A-ﬁber neurons in rodent DRGs
[10]. However, in hDRG sections, NF200 labeled both
large
(Fig. 1B). Double-staining
revealed co-localization of NF200 (NF200H) with TRPV1,
a marker for C-ﬁber neurons in the rodent DRG [26]
(Fig. 1C, D). Peripherin is another marker
for small
nociceptor neurons in the rodent DRG [27]. Consistently,
peripherin was also expressed by small-diameter hDRG
neurons (Fig. 1E). Limited size analysis showed that the
average diameters of TRPV1- and peripherin-positive
hDRG neurons were 44 ± 7 and 38 ± 7 lm, respectively
(n = 28–37 neurons/group). Our results are in agreement

Distinct Expression of Sodium Channel Subtypes
in Human and Mouse DRG Tissues

We used quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to compare
the transcriptional expression of seven Nav subtypes in
(Nav1.1,
and mDRGs: TTX-sensitive Navs
hDRGs
Nav1.2, Nav.1.3, Nav1.6, and Nav1.7) and TTX-resistant
Navs (Nav1.8 and Nav1.9). Notably, all these subtypes are
known to be expressed in rodent DRG neurons [15, 16, 28].
To deﬁne the relative expression levels of each subtype in
mouse and human DRG tissues, we calculated the per-
centage expression of each subtype based on the total
expression of all
these subtypes (Fig. 2A,B). Striking
species differences were found in Nav1.1, Nav1.6, Nav1.7,
Nav1.8, and Nav1.9 (Table 3). The ratio of Nav1.7
expression in the hDRG (49.2 ± 5.6%) was much higher
than that in the mDRG (18.2 ± 1.7%). On the other hand,
the mDRG had a much higher ratio of Nav1.8 (44.9 ± 2.4%)
than that of the hDRG (12.1 ± 2.1%). Also, the ratio of
Nav1.6 was higher in the hDRG (8.8 ± 0.8%) than in the
mDRG (3.3 ± 0.3%) (Fig. 2A, B).

Sodium Channel Subtype Expression in Human
DRGs Shows No Sex and Age Difference

expression of each Nav subtype in the hDRGs of 6 men and
6 women showed no sex difference in the expression of any
subtype (Fig. 2A). Similarly, their relative expression in
the mDRGs of 6 males and 6 females showed no sex
difference in the expression of any mouse Nav subtype
(Fig. 2B). Further comparison of the relative expression of
Nav1.7 in hDRGs also revealed no statistical differences
between men and women (Fig. 3A). We also analyzed
Nav1.7 expression in hDRG donors of different ages,
ranging from 27 to 76 years and found that although the
expression was slightly lower in older donors, there was no
signiﬁcant correlation between Nav1.7 expression and age
(Fig. 3B).

Paclitaxel Increases Nav1.7 Expression, Transient
Sodium Currents, and Action Potential Firing
Frequency in hDRG Neurons

Previous studies have shown that Nav1.7 is upregulated in
DRG neurons under chronic pain conditions such as diabetic
neuropathy, and contributes to the pathogenesis of neuropathic
pain [18, 29, 30]. Paclitaxel is a widely-used chemotherapeutic
drug that induces neuropathy and neuropathic pain [10, 31].
To mimic chronic pain in a dish, we treated dissociated hDRG
neurons with paclitaxel (0.1 and 1 lmol/L) for 24 h. qPCR
analysis revealed a signiﬁcant and dose-dependent increase in
Nav1.7 mRNA expression after the treatment (Fig. 4A). By
contrast, Nav1.8 mRNA expression in hDRG cultures did not
change after this treatment (Fig. 4B).

To assess the function of Navs including Nav1.7 in
hDRG neurons, we recorded transient Na? currents in
small-diameter neurons (\50 lm). In untreated hDRG
the amplitude of transient Na? currents was
neurons,
3131 ± 573.1 pA (n = 29 neurons from 3 DRGs/3 donors,
Fig. 5A, B). Notably, paclitaxel (1 lmol/L, 24 h) caused a
increase in the amplitude of transient Na?
signiﬁcant
currents (4853 ± 634.4 pA: Fig. 5B).

Finally, we investigated whether paclitaxel changes the
excitability of human nociceptors by recording action
potentials in small hDRG neurons. The rheobase for

123

10

inducing action potentials was 285.7 ± 59.5 pA (n = 7
neurons) in untreated hDRG neurons. After paclitaxel
treatment (1 lmol/L, 24 h), there was a slight decrease in
rheobase (216.7 ± 66.67 pA, n = 3 neurons, P [ 0.05,
unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test). This lack of signif-
icance may result from the small number of neurons
recorded. Current-clamp recording revealed that current
injection (500 pA, 1 s) evoked action potentials in hDRG
neurons (Fig. 6A). In untreated hDRG neurons, the ﬁring
frequency was 5.41 ± 0.74 Hz (Fig. 6B). Notably, pacli-
taxel (1 lmol/L, 24 h) caused a signiﬁcant increase in
ﬁring frequency (8.71 ± 1.10 Hz: Fig. 6B). This result
suggests a possible increase in the excitability of hDRG
treatment. However, additional
neurons after paclitaxel
features of neuronal excitability such as resting potential,
membrane resistance, and threshold current need to be
tested in future studies.

Discussion

There have been many failures in developing new anal-
gesics, because (1) molecular mechanisms identiﬁed in
rodents may not apply to humans and (2) animal models of
pain may not represent human pains [5, 6]. To ﬁll in this
translational gap, several groups including our own have
begun to test pain mechanisms in native hDRG neurons
obtained from human donors [7–11]. These studies reveal
that peripheral mechanisms of pain are likely to be shared
by mice and humans and demonstrate a translational
research strategy to improve the preclinical validation of
novel analgesics. We have recently demonstrated that the
autism gene SHANK3 is expressed by both mouse and
human DRG neurons and regulates TRPV1 function in the

DRG neurons of both species, offering a novel peripheral
mechanism of pain dysregulation in autism [11].

Although the role of human Nav1.7 has been well-
studied in heterologous cells and rodent DRG neurons by
over-expression of different human Nav1.7 mutants in
these cells, the speciﬁc role of Nav1.7 in native hDRG
neurons is unclear. Global Nav1.7-knockout mice recapit-
ulate the phenotype of human congenital indifference to
pain [32]. Nerve trauma after diabetes and spared nerve
injury have been shown to cause upregulation of Nav1.7 in
mDRG neurons and redistribution of Nav1.7 channels
toward peripheral axons, leading to enhanced neuropathic
pain in mice [29, 30]. However, it has also been shown that
pain induced by the chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin and
cancer-induced bone pain may not require the presence of
Nav1.7 channels [33]. Furthermore, endogenous opioids
appear to contribute to pain insensitivity in mice lacking
Nav1.7 [34]. Thus, there could be compensatory regula-
tions in mice lacking Nav1.7, emphasizing the importance
of studying Nav1.7 in native hDRG neurons.

[37], and SCN8A (encoding Nav1.6)

Our data have shown striking species differences in the
expression of different Nav subtypes. Especially, the ratio
of Nav1.7 expression in the hDRG (50%) is much higher
than in the mDRG (20%). On the other hand, the mDRG
has a much higher ratio of Nav1.8 (45%) than the hDRG
(15%), and a critical role of Nav1.8 in the pathogenesis of
neuropathic pain has been well documented in rodents
[35, 36]. It is reasonable to postulate that the high ratio of
expression of Nav1.7 in hDRG neurons is associated with
an enhanced role of this subtype in human pain conditions
compared with other subtypes. This notion is supported by
human genetics showing that both most pain-related gain-
of-function and loss-of-function mutations are found in
SCN9A [21–23], while fewer mutations have been found in
[8], SCN11A (encoding
SCN10A (encoding Nav1.8)
Nav1.9)
[38].
Inherited erythromelalgia (IEM), a severe pain syndrome
characterized by episodes of intense burning pain triggered
by warmth, is caused by mutations in Nav1.7 in sensory
and sympathetic neurons. A newly-identiﬁed IEM mutation
(Nav1.7-A1632G) in a multi-generation family is respon-
sible for hyperexcitability in sensory neurons, and the
increased responses to temperature also suggest a cellular
basis for the warmth-triggered pain in IEM [39]. It is
noteworthy that an hDRG neuron survived for 76 years in
our oldest donor (Table 1), whereas a rodent DRG neuron
or a heterologous cell only survives for a few days to a few
months. Thus, Nav1.7 in native hDRG neurons could be
regulated by different mechanisms. Interestingly, we did
not ﬁnd sex- and age-dependent changes in Nav1.7
expression in hDRG neurons, suggesting that maintaining
homeostasis of its expression is important for this critical
ion channel. However, paclitaxel, which is known to

induce neuropathy, caused a marked increase in Nav1.7
expression, associated with increases in the transient Na?
current and excitability (as revealed by increased action
potential ﬁring), in small-diameter (presumably nocicep-
tive) hDRG neurons. Although other Nav subtypes could
also contribute to the transient Na? current, Nav1.7 is a
major contributor to this TTX-sensitive current [18, 32].

In summary, naı¨ve hDRG neurons provide a transla-
in which to study voltage-gated Na?
tional model
channels such as Nav1.7 and ‘‘human pain in a dish’’.
hDRG neurons have been used to study acute inﬂamma-
tory pain mechanisms following stimulation by inﬂam-
matory mediators such as prostaglandin E2 [7], but they
can also be used to investigate neuropathic pain mech-
anisms after paclitaxel treatment as demonstrated in this
study. In future studies, we will try to collect hDRGs
from donors with chronic pain conditions to investigate
the regulation of Nav subtypes in human pain. We will
also conduct
to characterize the
expression of Nav subtypes in different populations of
hDRG neurons, as shown in mDRG neurons [40, 41]. It is
noteworthy that paclitaxel did not change Nav1.8 expres-
sion in hDRG neurons, in support of a previous report
that Nav1.8 does not contribute to chemotherapy-induced
mechanical allodynia in rats [42]. Thus, naive hDRG
neurons can be used to test new pain therapeutics such as
Nav1.7 inhibitors, as the last-step of target validation
before the initiation of clinical trials.
