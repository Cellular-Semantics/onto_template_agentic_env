## Background

Autonomic ganglia contain different types of neurons that can be identified by specific molecular markers like neurotransmitter enzymes and neuropeptides. Modern single-cell RNA sequencing helps classify these neurons into distinct groups based on their gene expression patterns.

Autonomic ganglia are clusters of nerve cell bodies that control involuntary functions like heart rate, digestion, and pupil size. These ganglia contain different types of neurons that can be identified using molecular markers - proteins that mark specific cell types or functions. Traditional methods use antibodies to detect markers like vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and galanin (GAL). VIP and PHI are neuropeptides that often occur together, while TH makes dopamine and norepinephrine, ChAT makes acetylcholine, nNOS makes nitric oxide, and GAL is another neuropeptide. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing allow scientists to classify neurons based on their complete gene expression profiles, creating transcriptomic classifications that can be compared with traditional marker-based identification methods.

## VIP Expression in Ciliary Ganglia

VIP expression in ciliary ganglia shows clear species differences in its distribution and localization. In rats, only a few ciliary ganglia and accessory ciliary neurons show VIP immunoreactivity, while in humans and guinea pigs, this VIP immunoreactivity appears instead in uveal ganglion cells (Wu et al., 2022). Beyond the cell bodies themselves, VIP-like immunoreactivity has been detected in presynaptic nerve terminals of avian ciliary ganglia, where VIP-like peptides could modulate acetylcholine receptors in living animals (Gurantz et al., 1994). This suggests that VIP serves both as a marker for specific neuron populations and as a functional modulator of synaptic transmission in ciliary ganglia, though the exact patterns depend on the species being studied.

## Tyrosine Hydroxylase Neurons in Intrinsic Cardiac Ganglia

The presence of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neurons in intrinsic cardiac ganglia has been confirmed across multiple species, though their prevalence shows considerable variation between studies (Moss et al., 2020)(Moss et al., 2021). While the majority of cardiac ganglia neurons are cholinergic (ChAT+), the proportion of catecholaminergic (TH+) neurons ranges widely across different investigations (Moss et al., 2020)(Moss et al., 2021). TH immunoreactivity appears in both small intensely fluorescent cells and larger neurons, with some studies reporting their absence in certain neuron populations while others show clear staining in larger neurons (Fedele et al., 2020).

A particularly interesting finding is the co-expression of both ChAT and TH in 10-20% of intrinsic cardiac nervous system neurons, suggesting these cells can synthesize both acetylcholine and catecholamines (Moss et al., 2020)(Moss et al., 2021)(Fedele et al., 2020). This dual capability is further supported by the colocalization of TH with vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT-2) in human intrinsic cardiac ganglia, indicating these neurons can synthesize, store, and release catecholamines (Fedele et al., 2020)(Jovanovic et al., 2014).

Species differences are evident in TH expression patterns. In humans, TH-immunoreactive nerve terminals clearly encircle postganglionic neurons, while this pattern is less distinct in pigs and mice (Tompkins et al., 2024). In rats, nerve fibers within ganglia stain positive for TH, but the marker is not detected in neuronal cell bodies (Evans et al., 2024). Additionally, galanin staining appears in a small proportion (less than 5%) of TH-positive neurons in stellate ganglia (Herring et al., 2012).

## Neurochemical Markers in Myenteric Ganglia

Myenteric ganglia neurons express ChAT, nNOS, VIP, and GAL in various combinations that correspond to different functional roles. Single-cell RNA sequencing studies combined with immunofluorescence investigations show that neurochemically distinct classes of enteric neurons express multiple mediators in various combinations (Llorente, 2024)(Morarach et al., 2020). For example, VIP and nNOS coexist in inhibitory motor neurons, certain interneurons, and a subset of submucosal VIP neurons, demonstrating complex neurochemical co-localization patterns (Llorente, 2024).

In human myenteric plexus, hierarchical clustering based on nNOS, VIP, and GAL expression reveals two main subgroups: NOS1+/VIP+/GAL+ neurons (17 neurons) and NOS1-/VIP-/GAL- neurons (31 neurons) (Wright et al., 2021). These subgroups show differential expression of regulatory genes including RBFOX1, ETV1, and BNC2 (Wright et al., 2021).

However, caution is needed when using these traditional markers to define specific neuron subtypes. The limitations of immunohistochemistry, especially when using restricted markers such as ChAT, nNOS, or VIP alone, can be inadequate for precise subtype classification given the intricate nature of neurochemical co-localization in enteric neurons (Llorente, 2024).

## Additional Evidence from Ciliary Ganglia

Beyond VIP expression, ciliary ganglia show unexpected neurochemical complexity through the co-expression of cholinergic and catecholaminergic markers. While virtually all ciliary ganglion neurons display ChAT immunoreactivity as expected for cholinergic transmission, many ciliary neurons also exhibit immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), with 25-40% of total cells showing TH immunoreactivity in rats (Landis et al., 1987)(Ernsberger et al., 2020). In humans, approximately 23% of ciliary ganglion neurons are TH-positive (Ernsberger et al., 2020).

Importantly, these TH-positive ciliary neurons represent a unique neurochemical phenotype. Some neurons show dopamine beta-hydroxylase-like immunoreactivity, but none contain detectable catecholamines, even after treatment with compounds that should enhance catecholamine detection (Landis et al., 1987). Unlike sympathetic neurons, these ciliary ganglion neurons do not co-express dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), indicating they cannot synthesize noradrenaline (Ernsberger et al., 2020).

The expression of TH in ciliary neurons can be influenced by developmental conditions. Rats that underwent neonatal sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine showed a greater proportion of neurons with detectable TH immunoreactivity in the ciliary ganglion, and both the TH-positive cell bodies and their axons in the iris showed more intense immunofluorescence (Landis et al., 1987). This TH expression pattern extends across species, being present in ciliary neuron cell bodies of mouse, guinea pig, and ferret (Landis et al., 1987).

## Integration with Transcriptomic Classifications

The integration of traditional neurochemical markers with modern transcriptomic classifications reveals both the value and limitations of marker-based neuron identification. Single-cell RNA sequencing studies, complemented by immunofluorescence investigations, show that neurochemically distinct classes of enteric neurons express multiple mediators in various combinations (Llorente, 2024)(Morarach et al., 2020). This complexity means that using restricted markers such as ChAT, nNOS, or VIP alone is inadequate for defining specific neuron subtypes due to the intricate nature of neurochemical co-localization (Llorente, 2024).

Transcriptomic approaches provide a more complete picture by identifying regulatory genes that distinguish neuron populations beyond traditional markers. In human myenteric plexus, hierarchical clustering based on NOS1, VIP, and GAL expression identifies two main subgroups, but these groups are further characterized by differential expression of regulatory genes including RBFOX1, ETV1, and BNC2 (Wright et al., 2021). This demonstrates that while traditional neurochemical markers remain useful for initial classification, transcriptomic data reveals additional molecular signatures that better define distinct neuron classes and their functional properties.
