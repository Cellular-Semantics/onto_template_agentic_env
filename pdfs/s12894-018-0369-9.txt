Abstract

Background: Although the pelvic autonomic plexus branches are considered to be a mixture of sympathetic and
parasympathetic nerves, little is known regarding the composite fibers of the pelvic plexus branches. This study
aimed to investigate the immunohistochemical features of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves in the pelvic
autonomic plexus branches.
Methods: Using 10 donated elderly male cadavers, the detailed topohistology of nerve fibers at and around the
bladder, seminal vesicle, prostate, and rectum was examined. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and vasoactive
intestinal polypeptide (VIP) were used as parasympathetic nerve markers; tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was used as a
sympathetic nerve marker. The myenteric plexus of the colon was utilized as a positive control.

Results: Most nerve fibers in the bladder, seminal vesicle, prostate, and rectum were both nNOS- and TH-positive.
Thus, pelvic plexus branches were classified into two types: 1) triple-positive mixed nerves (nNOS+, VIP+, TH+, thick
myelinated fibers + or -) and 2) double-positive mixed nerves (nNOS+, VIP-, TH+, thick myelinated fibers + or -).
Notably, triple-positive nerves were localized within the posterosuperior part of the plexus (near the rectum) and
travelled anteroinferiorly toward the posterolateral corner of the prostate. The posteriorly and inferiorly located
nerves were predominantly composed of parasympathetic, rather than sympathetic, fibers. In contrast, nerve fibers
within and along the bladder and seminal vesicle contained either no or few VIP-positive nerves. These superiorly
located nerves were characterized by clear sympathetic nerve dominance.
Conclusions: The nerves of the pelvic plexus branches were clearly classified into nerves around the bladder and
seminal vesicle (VIP-negative) and nerves around the prostate (VIP-positive). Although nNOS- and VIP-positive nerve
fibers are candidate cavernous nerves, cavernous nerve identity cannot be definitively concluded for these nerves in
the periprostatic region.

Background
Autonomic innervation of the pelvic viscera is formed
by sympathetic fibers from the inferior hypogastric
from the pelvic
plexus and parasympathetic fibers
splanchnic nerves [1, 2]. The genital organs and lower
urinary tract are controlled by the autonomic nervous
system, as well as the somatic nerves. Because functional
disruptions, such as urinary incontinence and sexual
dysfunction, represent important determinants of quality
of life, detailed anatomical studies of the pelvic neuro-
anatomy are essential to preserve continence, erection,
and bladder function after pelvic surgery [3, 4].

Immunohistochemistry is widely applied in pelvic
nerve research. However, as evaluation of the peripro-
static nerve distribution is typically performed using sur-
gically acquired specimens [5–7], the staining of a large
area, including adjacent organs, is generally not possible.
Therefore,
the pelvic
to investigate the anatomy of
plexus, use of the entire pelvic block of cadavers is ideal.
Nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and vasoactive intestinal
polypeptide (VIP) are used as parasympathetic nerve
markers, whereas tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is used as a
marker of sympathetic nerves [8]. Recent reports have
demonstrated that, in the human pelvic floor, a portion
of the pelvic plexus branches contained VIP-, nNOS-,
and TH-positive nerve fibers [9–11].

The aim of this study was to investigate the topohistol-
ogy of three types of pelvic nerve fibers (nNOS-, VIP-,
and TH-positive fibers) by comparison of the peripro-
static nerve configuration and distribution with that of
adjacent regions.

Methods
This study examined 10 donated male cadavers with a
mean age of 73 years (range, 64–82 years). The cause of
death was either ischemic heart failure or intracranial
bleeding; none of the cadavers had undergone abdom-
inal or pelvic surgery, as confirmed by review of patient
medical histories, as well as by macroscopic observation
of the abdominopelvic cavity. The 10 cadavers were do-
nated to Tokyo Dental College for research and educa-
tion on human anatomy in accordance with their
consent, and their use in research was approved by the
Ethics Committee of Tottori University Faculty of Medi-
cine. The study was performed in accordance with the
provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki 1995, as revised
in Edinburgh in 2000.

The donated cadavers had been fixed by arterial perfu-
sion of 10% v/v formalin solution, then stored in 50% v/v
ethanol solution for > 3 months. From each of the ca-
davers, a large tissue block, including the bladder, seminal
vesicle, urethra, prostate, and rectum, as well as any con-
nective tissue around these viscera, was prepared. After bi-
section along the midsagittal line, each of the hemiblocks

was cut into 15-mm thick sections; then, routine proce-
dures for paraffin-embedded histology were performed.
From each of the macroslices, large horizontal or sagittal
sections (70 × 50 mm) were prepared at 2–3-mm inter-
vals, then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).
After reviewing the large sections to identify target re-
gions, sections (50 × 20 mm) for immunohistochemistry
were cut, in close proximity to the former plane. Ultim-
ately, we obtained 2–5 large
and 8–20
standard-sized sections from a single paraffin block con-
taining a 15-mm-thick slice.

sections

Most sections were stained with H&E, whereas others
were stained via immunohistochemistry and elastic-tissue
Masson staining (a variation of Masson-Goldner staining).
Primary antibodies for nerve immunohistochemistry were
used based on the methods of Hinata et al. [12]; these com-
prised mouse monoclonal anti-human S100 protein (1:200
dilution, Dako Z0311; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), rabbit
polyclonal anti-human nNOS (1:200 dilution; Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), mouse monoclonal
anti-human VIP (1:100 dilution, Santa Cruz sc25347; Santa
Cruz, CA, USA), and rabbit polyclonal anti-human TH
(1:500 dilution, Millipore-Chemicon ab152; Temecula, CA,
USA). When possible, the four immunohistochemical stains

non-adjacent sections were sometimes used because of
failed immunostaining. As a positive control for immuno-
histochemistry, the myenteric plexus of the descending
colon was acquired from the 10 specimens; the colic my-
enteric nerves invariably exhibit a dense distribution of
nNOS-/VIP-coreactive nerve fibers, even in centenarians
[13]. The secondary antibody was labeled with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP), and antigen-antibody reactions were de-
tected via the HRP-catalyzed reaction with diaminobenzi-
dine. The immunohistochemistry-labeled samples were

Results
The tissue blocks that were prepared for horizontal sec-
tions contained the posterior part of the bladder, nearly
the entire seminal vesicle, the superoposterior part of
the prostate, the anterior wall of the rectum, and parts
of the levator ani muscle. The horizontal sections were
suitable for a better understanding of the topographical
anatomy in and around the bladder and seminal vesicle.
However, the periprostatic neurovascular bundle could
not easily be included in a block because of the large
mass of the prostate. Thus, to easily identify the peripro-
sections were necessary. A

into four areas: 1) the middle and superior area between

Topographical nerve anatomy is shown in Fig. 1c. Panels a, c, e, g, and i exhibit nNOS immunostaining, while panels b, d, f, and i display TH
immunostaining. Panels a and b (or i and j) are adjacent sections, whereas panels c and d (or e and f, g and h) are proximal sections. These
nerves did not contain fibers that were reactive for VIP (not shown). In all of these nerves, nNOS- and TH-positive fibers appear to be
intermingled, without clear localization. However, in panels a and b, triple-negative areas (putative myelinated sensory fiber-dominant areas; stars)
are visible. Panels g and h display nerves in the bladder detrusor, while panels i and j show nerves attaching to the seminal vesicle. Nerves along
the seminal vesicle are characterized by an abundance of TH-positive fibers. In contrast, bladder detrusor nerves contain an abundance of
triple-negative fibers (putative sensory fibers). All panels were prepared at the same magnification (scale bar in panel f, 0.1 mm)

prostate, such that the third area appeared to be con-
nected to the fourth area. All four areas of nerves exhib-
ited ganglion cell clusters, but the second and third
areas (3–10 clusters per horizontal section) contained
greater numbers than the others (1–5 clusters per hori-
zontal section). Numbers of cut nerve profiles per mm2
in each horizontal section ranged from 15 to 25 in the
first area, 22 to 38 in the second area, 8 to 13 in the

third area, and 5 to 18 in the fourth area. Therefore,
nerve density was consistently highest in the first (ante-
rosuperior) area of nerves, located between the bladder
and seminal vesicle.

More than 70% of nerves in the anterosuperior area
were thin (< 0.05-mm diameter), and the density was
higher along the seminal vesicle than the bladder
(Fig. 1c). In these nerves, TH-positive sympathetic fibers

branches). Topographical nerve anatomy is shown in Fig. 1b. Panels a, d, f, and h display nNOS immunostaining, while panels c, e, g, and i
exhibit TH immunostaining. Only panel b displays VIP immunostaining: the other nerves in this figure did not contain VIP-positive fibers (not
shown). Panels a–c (or f and g; h and i) are adjacent sections, whereas panels d and e are proximal sections. Arrows, arrowheads, and stars in
panels a–c indicate ganglion cells corresponding to each panel: two ganglion cells (stars) appear to be negative for all three markers. All VIP-
positive cells (panel b) appear to express nNOS (panel a). All TH-positive cells (panel c) do not express either nNOS or VIP. In all of these nerves,
nNOS- and TH-positive fibers appear to be intermingled and do not exhibit a clear localization. All panels were prepared at the same

were much more abundant than parasympathetic fibers,
especially in the thinner nerves (Fig. 2). The proportion
of TH-positive fibers in the nerve along the seminal
vesicle was much higher than the corresponding propor-
tion along the bladder. Sympathetic nerve dominance
was also observed in the first (middle and superior) area
between the seminal vesicle and rectum (Fig. 3). In con-
trast to the first and second areas, nerves in the third
areas
(posterosuperior) and fourth (posteroinferior)

contained VIP-positive fibers, although the number per
section was consistently lower than for nNOS-positive
nerves (Figs. 4 and 5). Furthermore, in these posterior
areas, the number of nNOS-positive fibers was often
equal to or greater than the number of TH-positive fi-
bers. In addition, with respect to intra-organ nerves,
both nNOS-positive fibers and TH-positive fibers were
present; these were adjacent to and alongside the glands
and mucosa of the prostate, seminal vesicle, and bladder.

Fig. 4 Immunohistochemistry of nerves in an area between the rectum and levator ani muscle (posterosuperior group of the pelvic plexus branches).
This area is characterized by the existence of VIP-positive nerves. The topographical relationship of the four nerves is shown in Fig. 1d. Panels a, d, g,
and j display nNOS immunostaining; panels b, e, h, and k exhibit VIP immunostaining; panels c, f, i, and l exhibit TH immunostaining. One of the four
nerves (panel e) does not express VIP. In a single nerve, panel d does not correspond to the site shown in panels e and f, as nNOS- (or TH-) positive
nerves are restricted to the upper (or lower) side of the panel. VIP-positive fibers appear to be intermingled with nNOS-positive fibers. In panel i,
TH-positive fibers are restricted to the left-hand side of the nerve. All panels were prepared at the same magnification (scale bar in panel a, 0.1 mm)

Similarly, the smooth muscles of the prostate and sem-
inal vesicle
contained a very high proportion of
TH-positive fibers, as well as multiple nNOS-positive fi-
bers. However, immunoreactive nerves were not found
in the bladder detrusor smooth muscles. Other areas of

nerves were characterized according to sympathetic
nerve dominance. Of note, in all four areas, the intrapel-
vic nerves consistently contained both nNOS-positive
and TH-positive fibers. In contrast, the pelvic nerve
branches, such as those surrounding the levator ani

bers (data not shown). Ganglion cells, albeit rare, con-
tained triple-negative fibers (Figs. 2a, b; 3a, b, c).

In a ganglion cell cluster (Figs. 3a, b, c; 5b), nNOS-positive
ganglion cells were consistently highest in number, followed
by TH-positive cells. Some nNOS-positive cells also

appeared to express VIP when observed in serial sec-
tions. The maximum diameter of cell bodies ranged
from 15 to 25 μm,
irrespective of their sympathetic
or parasympathetic function. TH-positive cells were
found either intermingled with, or in clusters sepa-
rated from, nNOS-positive cells (Fig. 3c).

Sympathetic nerve fibers were most frequently ob-
served in the superiorly located branches of the pelvic
plexus near the bladder and seminal vesicle; in contrast,
parasympathetic fibers, a portion of which expressed
VIP, were dominant in the inferiorly or posteriorly lo-
cated nerves near the prostate. Based on these observa-
tions, the pelvic plexus branches were classified into two
types: 1) triple-positive mixed nerves (nNOS+, VIP+, TH
+, thick myelinated fibers + or -); and, 2) double-positive
mixed nerves (nNOS+, VIP-, TH+, thick myelinated fi-
bers + or -). Figure 6 depicts representative pelvic plexus
including both triple-positive mixed nerves
branches,
and double-positive mixed nerves. The composition of
nerve fibers shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 is summa-
rized in Table 1.

Discussion
This study focused on the pelvic plexus branches, from the
lateral site of the bladder, seminal vesicle, and rectum, to
the posteroinferior site at and along the posterolateral cor-
ner of the prostate, in elderly male cadavers. Although lim-
ited regions of the peripheral pelvic plexus were examined,
several patterns were identified in the fiber composition of
the pelvic plexus branches. Nerves in the examined region
consistently included TH-positive fibers; further, many of
the plexus branches were both nNOS- and TH-positive.
Notably, the anterosuperior area (between the bladder and
seminal vesicle) and the middle and superior area (between

the

and rectum) did not

vesicle

VIP-positive nerve fibers. On the contrary, the posterosu-
perior area (between the rectum and levator ani muscle)
and the posteroinferior area (at and along the posterolateral
corner of the prostate) contained VIP-positive nerve fibers.
The hypogastric and pelvic splanchnic nerves both contain
nNOS-, VIP-, and TH-positive nerves [14, 15]. Kraima et
al. [15] reported that VIP-positive fibers were not present
in tissues isolated from the lumbar sympathetic chain; thus,
areas that do not include VIP-positive nerves may be sup-
plied by the lumbar sympathetic chain. In addition, a
non-parasympathetic pattern [−, −, +] was not evident in
the plexus branches, but was observed both inside and out-
side of the levator ani muscle; these nerves appeared to be
pudendal nerve branches. Few triple-negative fibers were
observed; these are candidate pure sensory nerves [10].

TH is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthetic path-
way of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that is found
in peripheral sympathetic nerves and their related gan-
glia; thus, TH is often used as a marker of sympathetic
nerves [10, 14–17]. Both nNOS and VIP have been used
as parasympathetic nerve markers of the pelvic plexus
branches [8–11]; nNOS is found in peripheral parasym-
pathetic nerves and catalyzes the formation of nitric
oxide [18], whereas, VIP is generally considered to be
released from cholinergic
the primary
smooth muscle vasodilator and secretomotor fibers [19].
With regard to lower urinary function, the bladder
neck is innervated by dense noradrenergic nerves, which
have been shown to cause smooth muscle contraction

and subsequent closure of the bladder neck during the
storage of urine [20]. During micturition, inhibition of
the sympathetic pathway may lead to opening of the
bladder neck and prostatic urethra [21]. Additionally,
high NOS activity was found in the urethra, whereas
intermediate activity was found in the bladder neck, and
comparatively low activity was found in the detrusor
muscle. VIP-containing nerves form a dense subepithe-
lial plexus and project to the detrusor muscle bundles of
the bladder [22]. VIP plays an important role in bladder
neck opening by promoting relaxation of the smooth
muscle [20]. With regard to sexual function, TH- and
VIP-positive nerve fibers are very abundant in the hu-
man prostate [23, 24] and are considered to play a role
in the expulsion of the contents of the prostate gland
during seminal emission, as well as during ejaculation,
which is largely under adrenergic control [21]. Sympa-
thetic innervation mediates corporeal vasoconstriction
it
and corporeal smooth muscle contraction;
causes penile detumescence after orgasm, and (in the ab-
sence of sexual arousal) maintains the penis in the flac-
cid state [25]. The perivascular and trabecular nerve
fibers within the corpus cavernosum exhibit positive

further,

immunostaining for both nNOS and VIP [16, 26]. Nitric
oxide is released by parasympathetic fibers and is a potent
vasodilator associated with the physiology of the male
erection. Nitric oxide and VIP participate in the erectile
process via activation of the nitric oxide/cGMP and ade-
nylyl cyclase/cAMP pathways, respectively [23, 24].

The present study demonstrated that nNOS-positive fi-
bers are present in the pelvic plexus branches, as well as
in the prostate, seminal vesicle, and bladder; further, the
number of cut nerves per mm2 decreases with proximity
to the periphery. Ganzer et al. reported that nerve planim-
etry, using a polyclonal antibody against the neural protein
S100, revealed that 75% of nerves from the seminal vesi-
cles do not reach the striated urethral sphincter level
along the prostate [27]. Thus, the nerves around the pros-
tatic apex may be the remaining nerves of the pelvic
plexus, after distribution to the prostate, seminal vesicle,
and bladder. Although nNOS immunoreactivity has been
used to identify cavernous nerves, previous data, suggest-
ing that nNOS-positive periprostatic nerves are cavernous
nerves, may have been overstated.

VIP immunoreactivity is also found in the human
penis, where the largest concentrations of VIP are
present in the cavernosum body [28]. The present study
demonstrated that approximately 10% of nerve fibers
progressing toward the prostate and cavernous tissues
were VIP-positive. Hinata et al. reported that there were
few VIP-positive fibers adjacent to, and posterior to, the
rhabdosphincter area [11]. Ehmke et al. reported that >
50% of perivascular nerve fibers and > 90% of trabecular
nerve fibers within the corpus cavernosum stained posi-
tive for both nNOS and VIP. Furthermore, NOS/VIP im-
munoreactivity was reduced (diabetes) or absent (lesion
of the cavernous nerve) in penile tissue taken from pa-
tients with neurogenic impotence [26]. Although nNOS-
and VIP-positive nerve fibers from the prostatic apex to-
ward the periphery are regarded as candidate cavernous
nerves, there may be considerable interindividual vari-
ation in nNOS and VIP immunoreactivity, correspond-
ing to erectile function.

the main route of

Many excellent studies have been published regarding
the macro- and microscopic anatomy of the pelvic auto-
nomic nerve plexus and its branches. Takenaka et al. re-
ported that
the cavernous nerve
branches from a location near the root of the pelvic
splanchnic nerves, then joins in a spray-shaped distribu-
tion to the central area of the neurovascular bundle,
travelling along the distal side of the pelvic plexus [2].
The distal pelvic plexus, including the cavernous nerves,
passes through the rectourethral muscle [29, 30]. Clinic-
ally, even after non-nerve sparing prostatectomy, erectile
function may be maintained [31, 32], which implies that
the cavernous nerves along the posterior side of the
prostate and urethra are preserved, in some cases, after

Muraoka et al. BMC Urology  (2018) 18:47 

Page 10 of 11

resecting the so-called neurovascular bundle. Further-
more, differences in the postoperative recovery of erect-
ile function depend on the quantity of damaged
cavernous nerves. Therefore, athermal dissection and re-
duced traction may lead to the preservation of function,
even when non-nerve-sparing procedures are used.

There are several limitations to the present study. Be-
cause of the lack of immunohistochemical analysis of
the hypogastric and pelvic splanchnic nerves, it was not
possible to propose a complete scheme from a pregangli-
onic fiber, via a ganglion cell and postganglionic fibers,
to the target organs. Additionally, nNOS immunohisto-
chemistry is difficult to successfully perform in cadaveric
specimens that have undergone long periods of preser-
vation [9]. Because the quality of nNOS immunohisto-
chemistry varies among individuals, we did not perform
a quantitative evaluation, which might have included a
determination of the percentages of each nerve type.

Conclusions
Because the dominance of VIP-positive nerve fibers var-
ied by site, nerves of the pelvic plexus branches were
clearly categorized as those nerves around the bladder
and seminal vesicle (VIP-negative) and those nerves
around the prostate (VIP-positive). Furthermore, the re-
sults confirmed that nNOS expression is a general char-
acteristic of the pelvic plexus branches, rather than a
specific characteristic of the cavernous nerve. Although
nNOS- and VIP-positive nerve fibers are candidate cav-
ernous nerves, the periprostatic nNOS-positive fibers
may not be cavernous nerves, even when they are ob-
served alongside VIP-positive fibers.
