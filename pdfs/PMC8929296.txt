Abstract
Human NaV1.9 (hNaV1.9), encoded by SCN11A, is preferentially expressed in nociceptors, and its mutations have been linked to pain
disorders. NaV1.9 could be a promising drug target for pain relief. However, the modulation of NaV1.9 activity has remained elusive. Here,
we identified a new candidate NaV1.9-interacting partner, protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7). Whole-cell voltage-clamp
recordings showed that coelectroporation of human SCN11A and PRMT7 in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons of Scn11a2/2 mice
increased the hNaV1.9 current density. By contrast, a PRMT7 inhibitor (DS-437) reduced mNaV1.9 currents in Scn11a1/1 mice. Using the
reporter molecule CD4, we observed an increased distribution of hLoop1 on the cell surface of PRMT7-overexpressing HKE293T cells.
Furthermore, we found that PRMT7 mainly binds to residues 563 to 566 within the first intracellular loop of hNaV1.9 (hLoop1) and
methylates hLoop1 at arginine residue 519. Moreover, overexpression of PRMT7 increased the number of action potential fired in DRG
neurons of Scn11a1/1 mice but not Scn11a2/2 mice. However, DS-437 significantly inhibited the action potential frequency of DRG
neurons and relieved pain hypersensitivity in Scn11aA796G/A796G mice. In summary, our observations revealed that PRMT7 modulates
neuronal excitability by regulating NaV1.9 currents, which may provide a potential method for pain treatment.

1. Introduction

Voltage-gated sodium channel subtype 1.9 (VGSC, NaV1.9) is
predominantly expressed in nociceptive neurons,
trigeminal
neurons, and myenteric neurons.9 NaV1.9 channels produce a
persistent TTX-R sodium current and act as a threshold channel
that contributes to the resting potential and prolongs the
depolarization response to subthreshold stimuli,13 lowering the
threshold for single action potentials and increasing the frequency

of action potential firing.5,30 Previous evidence suggests that
NaV1.9 acts as an effector of peripheral inflammatory pain in mice.
In 2013, we first reported that SCN11A mutations were linked to
familial episodic pain.44 After that, many SCN11A mutations were
found to be linked to human pain disorders.7,21 Therefore, NaV1.9
could be a promising target for pain treatment because it is only
associated with pain disorders and has not been reported to be
involved in other pathological conditions.

To date, 10 a subunits of VGSCs (NaV1.1-1.9 and the atypical
channel NaX) have been identified in mammals. NaV1.9 shows the
lowest homology with other NaV family members at the amino acid
sequence level, although it shares a common structural topology
with other a subunit
family members. These a subunits are
composed of a long, single polypeptide chain that comprises 4
homologous repeats (domains I-IV). The 4 domains are linked by 3
intracellular loops,9 which play an essential role in the regulation of
VGSCs by binding with or modifying other proteins. However, the
functions of intracellular domains in the NaV1.9 channel are only
partially characterized, primarily because the expression of functional
NaV1.9 in heterologous systems is difficult and studying this protein
in isolated neurons is challenging.10,22 To date, only a few studies
have described the regulation of
the kinetic properties and
subcellular localization of NaV1.9, including posttranslational mod-
ifications (phosphorylation and glycosylation),3,4,37 cytoplasmic
domain–binding proteins (contactin and FHF1B),23,24 and the G-
protein pathway.32,38 However, the detailed mechanism by which
NaV1.9 mutations lead to pain disorders is unclear. Recently, we
found that alcohol aggravated episodic pain in patients carrying both
the NaV1.9 mutation and the ALDH2 polymorphism. We success-
(Scn11aA796G/A796G) mice,
fully constructed NaV1.9-knockin (KI)
and a COX2 inhibitor effectively relieved pain hypersensitivity
in NaV1.9-KI mice.42 We also found the first agonist of NaV1.9

(spider venom–derived peptide HpTx1) that induces hyperalgesia in
NaV1.7-knockout mice.46 However, selective NaV1.9 inhibitors have
not yet been identified. Therefore, we aimed to find another strategy
for the treatment of NaV1.9-related pain by inhibiting the interaction
of NaV1.9 with other proteins.

In this study, we identified a novel

interacting protein (protein
arginine methyltransferase 7 [PRMT7]) with NaV1.9 by a yeast two-
hybrid (Y2H) screening system. We found that NaV1.9 is a new
nonhistone substrate of PRMT7 that binds loop1 of human NaV1.9
(hNaV1.9) and methylates arginine residue 519. Moreover, we found
that PRMT7 regulates the current density of NaV1.9 and action
potential firing of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Importantly,
the inhibition of PRMT7 significantly reduced the number of action
potentials fired in DRG neurons and inhibited formalin-induced
hyperalgesia in Scn11aA796G/A796G mice. Therefore, PRMT7 could
serve as a potential target for new analgesic drug development by
modulating NaV1.9.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Mice
Scn11a2/2 mice were kindly provided by Patrick Delmas.27
Scn11AA796G/A796G mice were described earlier,42 and Scn11a1/1
mice (C57BL/6J) were purchased from Hubei Provincial Center for
Disease Control and Prevention (Wuhan, China). All animals were
housed under 12-hour light/dark cycles with free access to food and
water. All animal experiments were approved by the Ethics
Committee on Animal Research of Huazhong University of Science
and Technology (Wuhan, China) and the Animal Care and Use
Committee of Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence
Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China).

2.2. Plasmid construction

The cDNA sequence encoding the first intracellular loop (residues
402-570) of mouse NaV1.9 (NM_011887.3) was subcloned into the
pGBKT7 vector for use as “bait” in the Y2H screen. The first
intracellular loop of human NaV1.9 (hLoop1) was fused to the pGEX-
6P-1 vector for glutathione S-transferase (GST)
fusion protein
expression. The tagged eukaryotic proteins were correspondingly
subcloned into the p33FLAG-CMV-7.1 and pEGFP-C1 vectors.
The pSIH1-H1-CopGFP-shRNA vector was used in the RNA
interference experiment (Table S1, available at http://links.lww.
com/PAIN/B444). The CD4-hLoop1 chimaeric construct was
modified and generated as described.12,45 The human CD4
(NM_000616.5) intracellular loop (residues 397-458) was replaced
with loop 1 of hNaV1.9 (residues 404-572) using overlapping
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Then, a hemagglutinin (HA) tag
was inserted after the signal peptide (residues 1-25).

For use in voltage-clamp recordings, the full-length cDNA of
PRMT7 was subcloned into a pIRES2-EGFP expression vector
such that the enhanced green fluorescent protein gene was
downstream of the PRMT7 ATG and connected with an internal
ribosome entry site (IRES)
the PRMT7 protein was
linker;
produced from this vector as independent proteins from the
same messenger RNA. The full-length cDNA of mouse PRMT7
(NM_145404.1) was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression
vector for use in current-clamp recordings.

2.3. Yeast two-hybrid assay

Mouse DRG cDNA library construction and Y2H screening
were performed with Matchmaker Library Construction &

PAIN®

Screening Kits according to the user manual
(Clontech
Laboratories, Inc, PT3955-1, Mountain View, CA). Candidate
clones were identified by growth on quadruple dropout (QDO)
medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and adenine or
on QDO-containing X-a-Gal medium. In yeast, a-galactosi-
dase (MEL1) is expressed in response to direct GAL4-based
Y2H interactions. This secreted enzyme hydrolyzes 5-bromo-
4-chloro-3-indolyl-a-D-glucopyranoside (X-a-Gal), causing
the yeast colonies to turn blue on QDO/X-a-Gal medium.
The hybrid N/C terminal core of PRMT7 (NM_019023.3) and
truncated loop1 of hNaV1.9 (NM_014139.2) were cloned into
the 2-hybrid expression vectors pGBKT7 and pGADT7,
respectively.

2.4. Cell culture and transfection

The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T was maintained
under standard conditions in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium
(Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Gibco, NSW, Australia) at 37˚C in 5% CO2. For transient
transfection, cells were transfected using LipoJet Transfection
Reagent (SignaGen, Rockville, MD) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions.

2.5. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting

Transfected cells were lysed in IP lysis buffer for 30 minutes on
ice. After lysis, the cells were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10
minutes at 4˚C. Total cell extracts were incubated with the
appropriate antibodies on a rotator overnight at 4˚C, after which
protein A agarose beads (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA) were
added for a continued 4 hours incubation. Next, the immuno-
precipitates were washed with IP lysis buffer and separated by
sodium dodecyl sulphate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
Proteins were detected using specific antibodies: mouse anti-
GST antibody (AE001, ABclonal, Wuhan, China), mouse anti-HA
antibody (AE008, ABclonal), mouse anti-GFP antibody (AE012,
ABclonal), rabbit anti-PRMT7 (A12159, ABclonal), mouse anti-
FLAG antibody (M185-3 L, MBL, Tokyo, Japan), rabbit anti-
NaV1.9 antibody (ASC-017, Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel),
rabbit anti-methyl (mono) arginine antibody (ICP0801, Immune-
Chem, Burnaby, Canada), control mouse immunoglobulin G
(IgG), and rabbit
IgG (B900620, 30000-0-AP, ProteinTech,
the endogenous immunoprecipitation
Wuhan, China). For
experiment, proteins were extracted from Scn11a1/1 and
Scn11a2/2 mouse DRG tissues using radio immunoprecipitation
assay (RIPA) cell
lysis buffer (P0013B, Beyotime, Shanghai,
China). The supernatant was then collected through centrifuga-
tion at 12,000 3g for 10 minutes, followed by preclearance for 2
hours at 4˚C with 20 mL of protein A. The treated supernatant was
incubated overnight with rabbit anti-PRMT7 antibody, and we
performed the subsequent steps described above.

2.6. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay

Glutathione S-transferase–tagged hLoop1 fusion vectors were
transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta cells, and expression
was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl-b-D-
thiogalactoside at 30˚C for 5 hours. GST fusion proteins were
lysed using ultrasound, purified with glutathione–sepharose
beads (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and subsequently
ly-
incubated with GFP-PRMT7–overexpressing HEK293T cell
sates overnight at 4˚C. After incubation, the beads were washed
with IP lysis buffer (P0013, Beyotime, Shanghai, China), and the

April 2022· Volume 163· Number 4

bound proteins that were pulled down were detected using
immunoblotting.

2.7. Cell fractionation

HEK293T cells were cotransfected with FLAG-hLoop1 and GFP-
PRMT7 or the empty GFP vector, harvested after 24 hours, and
lysed with low-frequency ultrasound after which the membrane
proteins were extracted using the Membrane and Cytosol Protein
Extraction Kit (P0033, Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Western
blotting was performed as described above.

2.8. Immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry

HEK293T cells transfected with the HA-CD4-hLoop1 fusion
protein were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes and
blocked with 5% albumin bovine V for 30 minutes at room
temperature. Then,
the cells were incubated with anti-HA
antibody overnight at 4˚C. Dissected DRG tissues were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4˚C and then immersed in
a 20% to 30% sucrose gradient for 24 to 48 hours at 4˚C for
cryoprotection. Dorsal root ganglion sections (12 mm) were cut
with a cryostat (Leica CM1950, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and
mounted onto slides for immunofluorescence staining. The slides
were exposed to an antigen retrieval solution before blocking with
5% albumin bovine V and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 2 hours at room
temperature. The slides were incubated with mouse anti-PRMT7
(sc-376077, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) and rabbit
anti-NaV1.9 primary antibodies overnight at 4˚C. After 3 5-minute
rinses, the HEK293T cells and slides were incubated with Alexa
Fluor 594-labelled goat anti-mouse IgG (A11020, Life Technol-
ogies, Carlsbad, CA) or Alexa Fluor 488-labelled goat anti-rabbit
IgG (A11070, Life Technologies) secondary antibodies for 2 hours
at room temperature. Cell nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-
Images were captured using an Olympus
2-phenylindole.
FV1000 confocal microscope system.

2.9. Drug administration

The PRMT7 inhibitor DS-437 (GLPBIO, GC45927, Montclair, CA)
was dissolved at 100 mM in DMSO and stored. The concentra-
tion of drug administered was 10 mM and 100 mM,19,39 as
obtained by diluting the stock solution (DMSO # 0.1%). DS-437
was incubated with the neurons for 1 hour before current-clamp
recordings. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed
for up to 1 hour.

2.10. Formalin test, hot-plate test, and von Frey test
Seven to 8-week-old mice (n 5 6 per group, the ratio of male to
female mice was approximately 1-1) were used in the behaviour
test. Before testing, the mice were placed in plastic testing
chambers and habituated to the testing environment for 30 min.33
The experiments were performed by investigators who were
blinded to the drug administration conditions.

For the formalin test, DS-437 was diluted in saline and injected
intraperitoneally. After 1 hour, formalin solution (5%, 20 mL) was
injected into the surface of the hind paw. The duration of licking
and biting behaviour was immediately recorded at 5-minute
intervals for 45 minutes. The duration was analysed in 2 phases:
the first phase (0-5 min) and the second phase (10-45 minutes).
For the hot-plate test, a hot or cold plate (Ugo Basile 35100,
Gemonio, Italy) set to 52˚C was used to test sensitivity to heat.40
The mice were placed in the testing chamber, observed for

nociceptive behaviour (licking, lifting paw, and flinching) which
indicates sensitivity to heat, and quickly removed. The latencies
were recorded 3 times. The mice were removed after a cutoff time
of 60 seconds.

For the von Frey test, von Frey filaments (Ugo Basile 37277,
Gemonio, Italy) were applied to test mechanical hyperalgesia
using the “up–down” method as previously described.8 The hind
paws were struck by filaments of increasing stiffness. Filaments
were carefully pressed upward at the sural nerve territory to
induce a slight bend, and pressure was applied for more than 5
seconds. When an animal withdrew its hind paw from the fibre,
the behaviour was scored as a response. All paws were tested 3
times, and the withdrawal latency was recorded as the average
value.

2.11. Electrophysiology

Dorsal root ganglion neurons were dissected and subjected to
conventional whole-cell patch-clamp recordings by using an
Axopatch 200b amplifier as described in our previous
studies.42,44 Equal numbers of male and female mice were
used. Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 or the control
vector was mixed with hNaV1.9 at a ratio of 10:2 and then
electroporated into Scn11a2/2 mouse DRG neurons by using
the Neon transfection system (Life Technologies). The bath
solution for voltage-clamp recordings contained 140 mM
NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM CdCl2,
20 mM TEA-Cl, 0.001 mM TTX, and 10 to 30 mM glucose (pH
7.4, adjusted with NaOH) and the pipette contained 135 mM
CsF, 10 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM
EGTA, 5 mM TEA-Cl, and 4 mM Mg-ATP (pH 7.4, adjusted with
CsOH).

Fire-polished electrodes were fabricated with a resistance
below 3 to 5 MV when filled with the pipette solution by PC-10
(Narishige). The pipette potential was zeroed before seal
formation. Eighty percent to 90% series resistance compensation
was applied to reduce voltage errors. Voltage-dependent
currents were acquired at 5 minutes after establishing the
whole-cell configuration.

Currents were elicited by 100-ms test pulses with the
potential ranging from 2120 to 110 mV at 5-mV increments.
The activation curves were fitted to a Boltzmann function as
follows: G/Gmax 5 1/(1 1 exp[Vm 2 V1/2)/k], where V1/2 is the
midpoint of activation and k is the slope factor. Steady-state
fast
inactivation was evaluated with a series of 500-ms
prepulses (2120 to 220 mV in 10-mV increments), followed
by a 50-ms step depolarization to 250 mV, and steady-state
inactivation curve were fitted with the function I/Imax 5 1/(1
111 exp[(V1/2 2 Vm)/k]).

Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 and the empty vector
were individually electroporated into Scn11a1/1 mouse DRG
neurons for current-clamp recordings. The pipette solution for
current recordings contained 140 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EGTA, 5 mM
HEPES, and 2 mM Mg-ATP (pH 7.3) with KOH (adjusted to 315
mOsm with dextrose), and the extracellular solution contained
140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM
HEPES (pH 7.3, adjusted with NaOH). The voltage threshold was
calculated from the first peak on dV/dt vs V plot.

2.12. Statistical analysis
The data are presented as mean 6 SEM. The data for the
comparison of 2 groups were analysed using the independent
samples t test, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and

756

T. Ma et al.·163 (2022) 753–764

two-way ANOVA were used to compare data for 3 or more
groups. Statistical analyses and graphic representations were
performed using Origin software (OriginLab Corp, Northamp-
ton, MA).

3. Results

3.1. Identification of protein arginine methyltransferase 7 as a
novel binding partner of mNaV1.9 using the yeast two-
hybrid system

To identify proteins involved in regulating NaV1.9 channels
through binding with the first loop (loop1), we screened the
mouse DRG cDNA library with the Y2H system using the first
intracellular loop of mouse NaV1.9 (mNaV1.9, residues 402-570)
as bait (Fig. 1A). Through high-stringency selection on QDO agar
plates, we acquired 258 positive yeast clones. Using the MEL1
reporter gene on QDO-containing X-a-Gal medium and bio-
informatic analysis of the library plasmid inserts, one of the
repetitive clones containing portions of the C-terminal region of
PRMT7 was identified (Fig. 1B). This interaction manifested in
yeast was reconfirmed by directed cotransformation of
the
purified library and bait plasmids (Fig. 1C). Pairwise BLAST
analysis using the Clustal Omega program revealed strong
homology between the mouse and human PRMT7 sequences
(85.1% identity and 96.4% similarity overall) (Fig. 1B; and Fig. S1,
available at http://links.lww.com/PAIN/B444) and loop1 of
NaV1.9 proteins (76.3% identity and 93.5% similarity overall)
(Fig. 1D). Therefore, we speculated that a functional relationship
exists between human PRMT7 and NaV1.9-loop1.

3.2. Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 binds NaV1.9 in
vitro and in vivo

Next, we examined and validated the interaction between the
loop1 fragment of hNav1.9 (hLoop1) and full-length PRMT7 by
GST pull-down and reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation assays.
The purified GST-hLoop1 fusion protein, but not GST alone,

Reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG or anti-GFP
antibodies, but not the IgG control, immunoprecipitated the

interacted with hLoop1 (Fig. 2B). Meanwhile, we tested the
binding of PRMT7 to other cytoplasmic domains of hNaV1.9 by
performing an immunoprecipitation assay in HEK293T cells
(NT, residues 1-142; hLoop2, residues 815-1051; and CT,
residues 1605-1791). We only detected binding between
GFP-tagged PRMT7 and hLoop1 (Fig. 2C). In vivo, PRMT7
coimmunoprecipitated with its partner protein mNaV1.9 from
Scn11a1/1 but not control
IgG or Scn11a2/2 mouse DRG
tissues (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, we observed that the PRMT7
protein colocalized with mNaV1.9 in mouse DRG sections, and
NaV1.9 expression in DRG neurons of WT mice showed an
;35.9% overlap with the expression of PRMT7 (Figs. 2E–F).
Our results indicated that this interaction also occurs endog-
enously in mouse DRG tissues.

3.3. Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 increases NaV1.9
currents by promoting its cell surface expression

We investigated the functional role of PRMT7 in the activity of
the hNaV1.9 channel in mouse DRG neurons. PRMT7 plasmid
or empty vector (mock) was cotransfected with SCN11A
plasmid into Scn11a2/2 mouse DRG neurons by electro-
poration. Voltage-clamp analysis revealed a significant in-
crease in the hNaV1.9 peak current density in neurons
overexpressing PRMT7 (2115 6 16.8 pA/pF, n 5 23)
compared with the control empty vector (266 6 10.4 pA/pF,
n 5 25; P , 0.01) (Figs. 3A and B). To further confirm that
PRMT7 is involved in hNaV1.9 current regulation, we then
analysed the changes in mNaV1.9 channels in wild-type
mouse DRG neurons incubated with or without DS-437
(PRMT7 inhibitor). The results showed that the inhibition of
PRMT7 significantly reduced the current density of mNaV1.9 in

100 mM DS-437: 2116.64 6 21.96, n 5 19, P,0.05) (Figs. 3C
and D). However, neither condition affected the voltage-
dependent activation curve or steady-state fast inactivation
curve of NaV1.9 (Fig. S2 and Tables S2 and S3, available at
http://links.lww.com/PAIN/B444).

Given the important role of PRMT7 in the modulation of NaV1.9
currents, previous studies have suggested that methyltransferase
is involved in protein translocation processes,
including cell
surface trafficking.6,43 Thus, we examined whether PRMT7
affects the subcellular distribution of hLoop1. For this experiment,
we constructed a chimeric protein as a reporter molecule that
was present on the surface of HEK293T cells (Fig. 3E).
Consequently, we examined the effects of PRMT7 on the
membrane distribution of chimeric proteins. We performed
subcellular fractionation of HEK293T cells coexpressing chimeric
proteins and GFP-PRMT7 or the empty GFP vectors to examine
the effects of PRMT7 on the membrane distribution of the
chimeras. Compared with the empty vector, overexpression of
PRMT7 significantly increased the amount of chimeric proteins in
the membrane fractions (Fig. 3F-H). By nonpermeabilized
immunofluorescence labelling of HEK293T cells, we found that
PRMT7 increased the relative fluorescence intensity of chimeric
proteins compared with the control (Fig. S3A and B, available at

3.4. Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 modulates NaV1.9
activity by binding and methylating hLoop1

Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 contains C-PRMT and N-
PRMT core domains in tandem. The Y2H assay was repeated to
verify that the interaction occurred mainly between hLoop1 and
the C-terminal core domain (residues 364-692) of PRMT7 (Fig.
S4A, available at http://links.lww.com/PAIN/B444). To define the
PRMT7 binding site in hLoop1, we performed a series of
truncated hLoop1 hybrid constructs with the C-terminal part of
PRMT7 for Y2H assays. The results revealed that the deletion of
proximal end residues of hLoop1 retained the interaction with
PRMT7, whereas mutants in which distal end residues were
deleted did not bind the PRMT7 C-terminal core. In particular, the
deletion of residues 563 to 572 completely eliminated the binding
of PRMT7 (Fig. S4B, available at http://links.lww.com/PAIN/
B444). We then constructed a series of 4-residue alanine
substitution mutations of hLoop1 among the 10 residues
identified to be critical for binding with PRMT7 (Fig. S4C and D,
available at http://links.lww.com/PAIN/B444). One of the 4 single
alanine substitution clones (563-566A) showed a considerable
growth defect on selective medium (Fig. 4A and Fig. S4C-D,
available at http://links.lww.com/PAIN/B444). Further confirma-
tion of the interactions between these mutants and the PRMT7-C
domain was obtained by performing b-galactosidase assays,
which allow direct visualization of protein interactions (Fig. S4D,
available at http://links.lww.com/PAIN/B444). These Y2H exper-
iments showed that the binding between PRMT7 C-terminal core
and cytoplasmic loop1 of hNaV1.9 mainly requires residues 563
to 566 (Trp, Leu, Cys, and Val).

Protein arginine methyltransferase 7, a class III methyl-
transferase, generates monomethylarginine residues of his-
tone or nonhistone substrates (Fig. S5, available at http://
links.lww.com/PAIN/B444). We observed that inhibition of
PRMT7 altered the activity of NaV1.9 channels. Therefore, we
tested whether PRMT7 methylates hLoop1 in vitro.
HEK293T cells expressing FLAG-hLoop1 were transfected
with control, GFP-PRMT7 or PRMT7 shRNA vectors, followed
by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies and
immunoblotting with antibodies against monomethylarginine
(MMA). Protein arginine methyltransferase 7 overexpression
enhanced hLoop1 methylation (Fig. 4B). Conversely, PRMT7
knockdown specifically decreased MMA-positive hLoop1
levels (Fig. 4C; and S6, available at http://links.lww.com/

to PRMT7 levels.

alanine mutations at arginine residues 519 (R519A), 521 (R521A),
and 519/R521 (R519A/R521A) in hLoop1 were examined. In
HEK293T cells, only the R519A mutant showed reduced MMA
immunoreactivity. None of the mutations affected the interaction
with PRMT7 (Fig. 4D). These data indicated that PRMT7 binds
residues 563 to 566 (Trp, Leu, Cys, and Val) of cytoplasmic loop1
and methylates hLoop1 at arginine 519 (R519me).

Moreover, the regulatory effect of PRMT7 on the current
density of hNaV1.9 was weakened when we mutated the binding
and methylation sites in hNaV1.9, although both mutants showed
markedly lower current densities than wild-type hNaV1.9 (Fig. 4E
and F). These results suggest that PRMT7 modulates NaV1.9
activity by binding and methylating NaV1.9-loop1.

NaV1.9 channels mainly respond to subthreshold stimuli and
modulate action potential firing.13 We analysed the impact of
mPRMT7 on neuronal excitability at basal mNaV1.9 protein levels

effects on action potential firing. We injected currents ranging
from 0 to 225 pA in 25-pA increments for 200 ms to transfected
DRG neurons and measured the representative current-clamp
responses to serial current pulse injection (Figs. 5A–D). Six
parameters related to action potential firing were analysed: the
resting membrane potential (RMP), rheobase, voltage threshold,
amplitude, half-width, and after hyperpolarization (AHP). Protein

However, no significant differences in RMP (mock: 244.8 6 1.0

27) were observed in the DRG neurons (Fig. 5F-G; and Fig. S7A-
C, available at http://links.lww.com/PAIN/B444). Importantly, the
frequency of action potentials in Scn11a1/1 mouse DRG neurons
transfected with the PRMT7 plasmid was significantly higher than
that in mock-transfected cells in response to a similar stimulus
from 50 pA to 225 pA, but not in Scn11a2/2 mouse DRG neurons
(Fig. 5H). These results indicate that mPRMT7 increases
neuronal hyperexcitability by decreasing rheobase.

3.6. A protein arginine methyltransferase 7 inhibitor reduced
the excitability of Scn11aA796G/A796G mouse dorsal root
ganglion neurons

To further test whether the inhibition of PRMT7 can reduce
neuronal activity by decreasing NaV1.9 currents, we used
Scn11aA796G/A796G mouse DRG neurons, which exhibited
neuronal hyperexcitability through gain-of-function mNaV1.9
channels that lead to hyperalgesia.42 We analysed the effects of
the PRMT7 inhibitor DS-437 on neuronal excitability in DRG
neurons from Scn11aA796G/A796G and Scn11a1/1 mice by
performing current-clamp recordings and determining the
representative current-clamp responses to serial current pulse
injections (Fig. 6A). DS-437 (100 mM) significantly increased
rheobase (control: 42.31 6 4.37 pA, n 5 31; 10 mM: 50.00 6
4.35 pA, n 5 22; 100 mM: 63.46 6 6.71 pA, n 5 21)
in
Scn11aA796G/A796G mouse DRG neurons (Fig. 6B). However, the

significantly altered (Figs. 6C–D; and Fig. S7D-F, available at
http://links.lww.com/PAIN/B444).
In addition, DS-437 promi-
nently attenuated the action potential firing in Scn11aA796G/A796G
mouse DRG neurons (Fig. 6E). However, DS-437 did not affect
the frequency of action potentials fired, rheobase (control: 56.67

(control: 249.00 6 0.94 mV, n 5 21; 100 mM: 249.61 6 1.20, n
5 23), voltage threshold (control: 214.83 6 1.24 mV, n 5 21;
100 mM: 215.17 6 1.40, n 5 23), amplitude (control: 126.40 6
2.49 mV, n 5 21; 100 mM: 126.29 6 3.08 mV, n 5 23), half-width
(control: 1.48 6 0.14 ms, n 5 21; 100 mM: 1.46 6 0.14 ms, n 5
23), or AHP (control: 224.47 6 1.03 mV, n 5 21; 100 mM:
224.09 6 1.69, n 5 23) in Scn11a1/1 mouse DRG neurons
(Figs. 6B–E; and Fig. S7D-F, available at http://links.lww.com/
PAIN/B444).

In preliminary in vivo experiments, the intraperitoneal injection
of DS-437 (1.6 mg/kg) reduced the duration of licking and lifting of
the hind paws in Scn11a1/1 and Scn11aA796G/A796G mice after
intraplantar administration of 5% formalin in the first and second
phases, and 0.8 mg/kg DS-437 also decreased paw licking and
lifting time in the second phase in Scn11aA796G/A796G mice
compared with the controls (Figs. 6F–G). In addition, 1.6 mg/kg
DS-437 increased the hot palate latency and reduced mechan-
ical sensitivity at 1 and 2 hours after intraperitoneal administration,
and 0.8 mg/kg DS-437 reduced mechanical sensitivity in
Scn11aA796G/A796G mice but not Scn11a1/1 mice (Figs. 6H–I).
Altogether, these results indicate that inhibiting the activity of
PRMT7 may relieve pain hypersensitivity by decreasing DRG
neuron excitability in Scn11aA796G/A796G mice.

4. Discussion

NaV1.9, as a threshold channel for action potential electrogen-
esis, is particularly important in inflammatory,2 neuropathic,31 and
visceral14 pain in rodent models, and variants of SCN11A in
humans lead to congenital
insensitivity to pain and painful
syndromes.10 However, the regulatory mechanisms of NaV1.9

www.painjournalonline.com

761

channel activity are still largely uncharacterized, especially post-
translational modifications. In this study, we identified PRMT7 as
a new binding partner of NaV1.9. Protein arginine methyltransfer-
ase 7 contains the C-terminal and N-terminal domains. We found
that the C-terminal part of PRMT7 exhibits strong binding to
hLoop1 (Fig. S4A, available at http://links.lww.com/PAIN/B444).
As a member of the protein arginine methyltransferase family,
PRMT7 binds loop1 of hNav1.9 through residues 563 to 566
(WLCV motif) (Figs. S4C and S4D, available at http://links.lww.
com/PAIN/B444) and methylates arginine residue 519 (Fig. 4D).
These data further confirmed that the C-terminal core domain of
PRMT7 participates in protein methylation and revealed that the
PRMT7 substrate-binding region is distinct from the arginine
methylation site.

However, the detailed mechanism by which PRMT7 regulates the
NaV1.9 current remains unknown. There may be 2 possible
mechanisms: intracellular protein trafficking and protein stability.
The mammalian PRMT family contains 9 highly related members
(PRMT1-PRMT9)
that share common structure and signature
methyltransferase motifs, which have been shown to modulate the
nucleus–cytoplasm translocation of RNA-binding proteins25,35 and
molecule cell surface trafficking.6 PRMT3 or PRMT5 could increase
the NaV1.5 current density by enhancing NaV1.5 cell surface
expression.6 In our study, by using reporter molecules, we found that
PRMT7 increased the expression of the first loop of hNaV1.9 in the
membrane compartment (Fig. 3F). On the other hand, arginine
methylation by protein arginine methyltransferases could increase
protein stability and reduce ubiquitination.34 It would be interesting to
determine whether PRMT7-methylated NaV1.9 channels exhibit
increased stability with extended duration of localization at the cell
surface because PRMT7 did not affect the electrical properties of the
hNaV1.9 channel. In addition, a study reported that the RRR motif in
the first intracellular loop of NaV1.8 is responsible for restricting its
surface expression.45 Although we cannot exclude the possibility
that increased single-channel conductance may regulate current
density, we propose the following hypothesis regarding the
mechanism of NaV1.9 membrane targeting: Methylation of R519
of hLoop1 by PRMT7 is required for NaV1.9 trafficking and its
subsequent accumulation on the cell surface (Fig. 7).

NaV1.7, NaV1.8, and NaV1.9 are preferentially expressed in the
peripheral nervous system and thereby regulate neuronal
excitability and pain signals.7 Multiple specific blockers that act
on NaV1.7 and NaV1.8 have undergone clinical trials and have
been validated as targets for pain treatment.1 To date, a NaV1.9-
specific inhibitor has not been developed because NaV1.9
exhibits very poor heterologous expression. However, NaV1.9-
related familial episodic pain was remarkedly relieved by
treatment with NSAIDs in patients.20,29,44 According to a recent
study, parecoxib can reduce NaV1.9 currents and inhibit neuronal
excitability.42 However, the detailed mechanism remains unclear.
In this study, overexpression of PRMT7 increased hyperexcit-
ability by decreasing rheobase in Scn11a1/1 mouse DRG
neurons but not Scn11a2/2 mouse DRG neurons. The increased
rheobase in the presence of the PRMT7 inhibitor induced a
decrease in neuronal excitability in Scn11aA796G/A796G mouse
DRG neurons but not in Scn11a1/1 mouse DRG neurons (Figs.
6A–E). In a previous study, rheobase was somewhat greater in
Scn11a2/2 mouse DRG neurons, but action potential firing was
not affected.31 On the other hand, PRMT7 regulates the
activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase by interacting
with p38 and stabilizing the active form,16 but p-p38 was
detected in a few DRG neurons without the application of tumor
necrosis factor a (TNFa)18 and shown to be associated with
inflammatory and neuropathic pain.26 In addition, PRMT7

regulates the number of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic
nuleotide-gated (HCN) channels by controlling HCN1 protein
expression.19 However, HCN1 is expressed in medium to large
DRG neurons,11,36 and HCN expression was shown to increase
with hind limb inflammation induced by complete Freund’s
adjuvant (CFA) in some of the small DRG neurons.41 Therefore,
we believe that PRMT7 regulates neuronal excitability mainly by
modulating NaV1.9 activity in DRG neurons.

NaV1.9 mutations that cause large hyperpolarizing shifts in
voltage dependence of activation of NaV1.9 cause large

depolarizing shifts in RMP and silencing of nociceptors,
whereas mutations that cause modest hyperpolarizing shifts
in voltage dependence of activation of the channel cause
smaller depolarizing shifts in RMP and induce hyperexcitability
of nociceptors.7,15 However, the inhibition of NaV1.9 attenu-
ated hyperexcitability in Scn11aA796G/A796G mouse DRG
neurons (Fig. 6E). NaV1.9 could be a promising strategy for
inflammation and NaV1.9-related hyper-
treating peripheral
algesia. In this study, a PRMT7 inhibitor relieved formalin-
induced pain hypersensitivity in WT and NaV1.9-KI mice. In

Figure 7. Proposed working model of PRMT7-mediated NaV1.9 trafficking and cellular excitability. The PRMT7 C-terminal domain interacts with residues 563 to

in this loop using S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) as a methyl donor to produce S-
adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy). Human NaV1.9; R519 me is involved in the regulation of NaV1.9 trafficking to the cell surface through an undefined
mechanism. Consequently, altered cell surface expression of NaV1.9 increases sodium current density, leading to hyperexcitability of DRG neurons. DRG, dorsal

addition, inhibiting PRMT7 activation attenuated mechanical
and thermal sensitivity in NaV1.9-KI mice but not WT mice

contributes to pain signal processing under pathological
conditions (inflammatory and neuropathic pain, as well as
gain-of-function mutation).2,20,31,44

In summary, we have identified a new signalling link between
PRMT7 and NaV1.9 involved in the control of neuronal excitability
and provided a mechanism underlying the prevention of neuronal
hyperexcitability through sodium conductance. This study may
also offer a new research area, namely, the posttranslational
modification of NaV1.9, which contributes to the development of
NaV1.9-related analgesic treatments.
