BACKGROUND. Neuronal remodeling in human heart disease is not well understood.

METHODS. Stellate ganglia from patients with cardiomyopathy (CMY) and refractory ventricular 
arrhythmias undergoing cardiac sympathetic denervation (n = 8), and from organ donors with 
normal hearts (n = 8) collected at the time of organ procurement were compared. Clinical data 
on all subjects were reviewed. Electron microscopy (EM), histologic, and immunohistochemical 
assessments of neurotransmitter profiles, glial activation and distribution, and lipofuscin 
deposition, a marker of oxidative stress, were quantified.

RESULTS. In CMY specimens, lipofuscin deposits were larger, and present in more neurons (26.3% 
± 6.3% vs. 16.7% ± 7.6%, P < 0.043), than age-matched controls. EM analysis revealed extensive 
mitochondrial degeneration in CMY specimens. T cell (CD3+) infiltration was identified in 60% of 
the CMY samples, with one case having large inflammatory nodules, while none were identified in 
controls. Myeloperoxidase-immunoreactive neutrophils were also identified at parenchymal sites 
distinct from inflammatory foci in CMY ganglia, but not in controls. The adrenergic phenotype of 
pathologic samples revealed a decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase staining intensity compared with 
controls. Evaluation of cholinergic phenotype by staining for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter 
revealed a low but comparable number of cholinergic neurons in ganglia from both groups and 
demonstrated that preganglionic cholinergic innervation was maintained in CMY ganglia. S100 
staining (a glial cell marker) demonstrated no differences in glial distribution and relationship to 
neurons; however, glial activation demonstrated by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining was 
substantially increased in pathologic specimens compared with controls.

CONCLUSIONS. Stellate ganglia from patients with CMY and arrhythmias demonstrate 
inflammation, neurochemical remodeling, oxidative stress, and satellite glial cell activation. These 
changes likely contribute to excessive and dysfunctional efferent sympathetic tone, and provide a 
rationale for sympathectomy as a treatment for arrhythmias in this population.

Introduction
Neuroendocrine activation is central to the pathogenesis of heart disease. The influence of excess sympathetic 
activation on cardiovascular dysfunction, arrhythmias, and sudden death is well established (1, 2). Modulation 
of adrenergic signaling via pharmacologic and interventional approaches (3–5) is emerging as a major thera-
peutic strategy in managing ischemic (ICM) and nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM), and arrhythmias.

Functional and structural remodeling of  sympathetic neurons in stellate ganglia (SGNs) of  animals 
with  ICM  and  NICM  suggest  that  cardiac  injury  and  the  resulting  chronic  neurohormonal  activation

induce alterations in SGNs that facilitate the enhanced sympathetic tone seen in these animal models (5, 
6).  Data  in  humans  are,  however,  scarce.  Morphological  size  of   SGNs  along  with  synaptic  density  are 
increased in patients with cardiomyopathy (CMY) and arrhythmias (3). Further, in patients with inherited 
channelopathies undergoing sympathectomy for recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, evidence of  inflamma-
tion was demonstrated (7). The neurochemical properties of  SGNs from humans with CMY and arrhyth-
mias, in whom chronic sympathoexcitation is characteristic, remain unknown.

The  goal  of   this  study  was  to  determine  how  severe  cardiac  pathology  alters  SGN  neurochemistry, 
as  well  as  satellite  glial  cell  (SGC)  distribution  and  functional  state,  by  comparing  stellate  ganglia  from 
patients with CMY and arrhythmias undergoing cardiac sympathetic denervation, with those from control 
subjects serving as heart and/or lung donors.

Results
Table 1 shows characteristics of  the CMY and control subjects included in the study. The mean age of  the 
control subjects in the study was 28 ± 8 years, while the mean age for the CMY subjects was 44.5 ± 15.4 
years. In total, 8 donors and 16 CMY patients were included in the study.

Ganglia from CMY patients exhibit evidence of  oxidative stress. Lipofuscin, which is formed and accumulates 
in response to aging, as well as oxidative stress (8, 9), is a marker that is readily apparent in H&E–stained 
sections. Accordingly, we examined ganglia from control and CMY groups for lipofuscin accumulation.

(mean ± SD, n = 6 and 8 for control and cardiomyopathy, respectively, 
P = 0.218, Mann-Whitney test). Scale bars: 25 μm (A and C) and 50 
μm (B and D). (G–J) Transmission electron microscopic images of 
stellate ganglion neurons from control (G and I) and cardiomyopathy 
(H and J) subjects. Few oxidized lipid deposits exist in control (thin 
arrow), unlike neurons from cardiomyopathy subjects, which demon-
strate numerous deposits, exhibit vacuolization (thick arrows), and 
mitochondrial degeneration (arrowheads). Scale bars: 2 μm (G and H) 
and 500 nm (I and J).

Given the age dependence of  lipofuscin deposition, age-matched control and CMY specimens were com-
pared. As shown in Figure 1, a significantly greater percentage of  neurons in CMY ganglia showed lipofus-
cin deposition compared with controls (26.3% ± 6.3% vs. 16% ± 7.6%, P = 0.043).

Oxidative  stress  is  directly  linked  to  mitochondrial  function;  therefore,  we  performed  transmis-
sion electron microscopy (TEM) to examine whether mitochondria were structurally different between 
CMY  and  control  subjects.  TEM  revealed  extensive  mitochondrial  degeneration,  with  mitochondria 
in  different  phases  of   vacuolization  identified  (Figure  1,  G–J).  In  addition,  neurons  from  pathologic 
subjects showed numerous oxidized lipid deposits.

Leukocyte  infiltration  is  a  common  feature  of   stellate  ganglia  from  CMY  patients.  Further  examination  of  
H&E–stained sections of  left stellate ganglia (LSG) revealed prominent, dense clusters of  leukocytes in one 
CMY patient (Figure 2). Leukocytes in this ganglion can be seen completely surrounding neurons (Figure 
2, B and C), which stained intensely for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, Figure 2D). Much smaller sites of  leu-
kocyte infiltration were found in ganglia from 2 other CMY patients, but none were evident in ganglia from 
the control patients. There was an overall incidence of  60% in CMY patients (P < 0.01).

To further evaluate ganglionic inflammation, immunoreactivity to myeloperoxidase (MPO) was exam-
ined. MPO, a major component of  neutrophil activity, is stored in large quantities in cytoplasmic granules 
and released in response to cellular activation. As shown in Figure 2, E–H, MPO immunoreactivity in con-
trol ganglia was only present in cells within blood vessels. In marked contrast, ganglia from CMY subjects 
demonstrated extracellular MPO deposits and MPO-immunoreactive neutrophils that were present in the 
parenchyma and associated with neurons. Further, few of  the inflammatory infiltrates shown in Figure 2, 
C and D were MPO immunoreactive, suggesting that most are T cells (10). The presence of  intraganglionic 
T cells was subsequently confirmed with CD3 staining (Figure 2, J–L).

SGNs from CMY patients exhibit a shift in adrenergic profiles. Stellate ganglia were stained for TH to identify 
adrenergic  neurons.  Adrenergic  soma  and  nerve  fibers  were  abundant  in  ganglia  from  both  control  and 
CMY patients (Figure 3, A and B), but the intensity of  TH immunoreactivity in the cell bodies varied dif-
ferently between groups (Figure 3C). In the control state, most neurons stained intensely for TH (70.9% ± 
5.2%), compared with moderately stained (26.6% ± 5.6%), and TH-negative neurons (4.5% ± 1.9%, P < 
0.001). CMY resulted in a significant shift in the distribution of  relative intensity of  TH staining, with mod-
erately and intensely stained neurons being equivalent (50% ± 10.1% vs. 43.4% ± 11.1%, respectively, P = 
0.2). There was no significant difference between the percentage of  TH-negative neurons in control versus 
CMY patients (4.5% ± 1.9% vs. 6.6% ± 1.3%, P = 0.2).

trols. Scale bars: 100 μm. (C) The graphical summary of the neurochemical shift in adrenergic phenotype of the stellate ganglion neurons from both groups is

opathy, respectively). Horizontal lines indicate significant differences in percentage of neurons in specified staining categories. *P < 0.05, ****P < 0.001.

Cholinergic varicosities are not altered by CMY. Cholinergic elements within the stellate ganglia were iden-
tified  by  using  an  antibody  against  the  vesicular  acetylcholine  transporter  (VAChT).  Extensive  choliner-
gic varicosities were present in ganglia from both groups and frequently surrounded cell bodies that were 
revealed by background level of  staining. The presence and distribution of  these varicosities, which are pre-
ganglionic cholinergic fibers that provide excitatory input to the SGNs, did not differ between control and 
CMY subjects (Figure 4). Light to moderate staining for VAChT was evident in only a few SGNs (Figure 
4), with no difference between controls and CMY patients.

Glial activation in pathological ganglia. SGCs in peripheral ganglia regulate the neuronal microenviron-
ment and are important elements in neuronal function in health and disease (11–14). Using an antibody 
against the glia cell marker S100, we identified S100-positive satellite cells in close association with human 
SGNs (Figure 5, A and B). In fact, neurons were entirely enveloped by SGCs. The distribution and asso-
ciation  of   SGCs  with  SGNs  were  not  significantly  different  between  control  and  CMY  subjects  (Figure 
5, C–F). S100-positive glial cells were also associated with nerve fibers in ganglia from control and CMY 
patients, with no obvious difference between groups.

We next examined glial cell activation in ganglia from CMY and control subjects using immunoreac-
tivity to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as a marker. As shown in Figure 6, compared with controls 
(Figure 6, A and B), ganglia from CMY subjects demonstrated substantially more GFAP immunoreactivity 
(Figure 6, C and D). GFAP-positive satellite cells were often observed surrounding neurons in ganglia from 
CMY patients but not in those from control patients (Figure 6, B and D). Likewise, ganglia from CMY 
patients had higher GFAP staining of  glial cells associated with intraganglionic nerve fibers.

Discussion
Major findings. The major findings of the present study are: (a) SGNs from subjects with CMY and arrhythmias 
exhibit evidence of oxidative stress and a neurochemical shift in adrenergic but not cholinergic phenotype; 
(b) ganglia from CMY patients are characterized by leukocyte infiltration, the presence of CD3+ T cells, and 
MPO-positive neutrophils in the parenchyma; and (c) activation of glial cells, including perineuronal satellite 
cells  and  glial  cells  associated  with  intraganglionic  nerve  fibers.  These  findings  provide  direct  evidence  for 
inflammation and ongoing pathological remodeling within the stellate ganglia of CMY patients and support 
strategies aimed at mitigating adrenergic neurotransmission mediated by the stellate ganglia.

Oxidative stress and inflammation. The accumulation of  lipofuscin and degeneration of  mitochondria are 
indicators  of   cellular  oxidative  stress  (8,  9,  15).  Increased  metabolic  activity  is  associated  with  increased 
rate of  lipid peroxidation, an important step in lipofuscin formation and accumulation. In addition, oxida-
tive stress is recognized to be a trigger for inflammation (16). Our findings of  lipofuscin accumulation sug-
gest increased activity of  SGNs resulting in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction as a result. This

pathophysiological  process  may  contribute  to  local 
inflammation seen in the ganglia and evidenced by 
leukocyte  infiltration  and  activation  of   SGCs.  The 
trigger for increased neuronal activity and oxidative 
stress may be increased cardiac afferent neurotrans-
mission,  which  increases  efferent  sympathetic  tone 
via a spinal reflex mechanism (17). Other etiologies 
may include circulating neurohormonal signals such 
as  angiotensin  II  (18,  19)  or  brainstem-mediated 
increases  in  efferent  sympathetic  outflow  (20),  all 
of   which  have  been  described  in  CMY  and  heart 
failure  states.  Cardiac  inflammation  and  oxidative 
stress  induced  by  repeated  defibrillation  might  also 
contribute to ganglion pathology (21). The possible 
relationship  between  ganglion  inflammation  and 
cardiac  arrhythmias  was  previously  reported  (22, 
23);  however,  the  suggested  mechanisms  were  viral 
or unknown. We present evidence potentially impli-
cating enhanced neuronal activity, and the oxidative 
stress (resulting from this metabolic activity) as a trigger for inflammation. MPO, released from neutrophils 
(10), is an important modulator of  both acute and chronic inflammation (24). Oxidants derived from MPO 
are  known  to  interfere  with  cellular  physiologic  processes.  The  presence  of   MPO-containing  neutrophils 
in association with neurons may suggest ongoing neuronal dysfunction and enhanced cardiac sympathetic 
instability,  although  an  important  factor  to  consider  is  the  timing  of   ganglia  collection  in  organ  donors, 
which occurred following cessation of  circulation in most cases.

Adrenergic profiles in patients with CMY and ventricular arrhythmias. Enhanced sympathetic tone, mediated 
in part by neurotransmission through stellate ganglia, is associated with the progression of  cardiovascular 
pathogenesis and risk of  arrhythmias and sudden death (1). The adrenergic marker TH, which catalyzes 
the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of  catecholamines, is produced in the cell body and transported to 
nerve terminals where norepinephrine is synthesized, stored, and released. The decrease in intensity of  TH 
staining in soma of  SGNs from CMY patients may appear counterintuitive; however, it likely represents 
mobilization of  enzyme to the nerve terminals to support catecholamine generation and release. In addi-
tion to reported structural changes to neurons (25–27), the findings of  the present study support enhanced 
activity in SGNs in patients with CMY and arrhythmias.

Cholinergic properties were not different between CMY and control patients. Cholinergic neurons make 
up a minority of SGNs, and are postulated to innervate non-cardiac structures of the upper thorax, for exam-
ple sweat glands. Whether cholinergic neurons in the stellate ganglia have a role in cardiac neurotransmission 
is not clear. Studies in animal models have suggested that cholinergic remodeling occurs in cardiac disease. 
In a rodent model of nonischemic heart failure (28), sympathetic-to-cholinergic transdifferentiation of SGNs 
mediated by gp130 cytokines was reported. In a porcine model of ischemic CMY (6), fewer cholinergic SGNs 
were identified when compared with control animals. Although these findings in animal models of subacute 
pathology suggest that shifts in the neurotransmitter phenotype of SGNs can occur with pathology, choliner-
gic remodeling does not appear to be a feature of more severe and complex chronic CMY in humans.

SGCs  closely  associated  with  SGNs  are  activated  by  cardiac  pathology.  The  microenvironment  in  which 
SGNs function is regulated by SGCs, which ensheathe the somata of  the sympathetic neurons and the 
synaptic  inputs  to  their  dendrites  (11).  Accordingly,  these  glial  cells  are  well  placed  to  affect  synaptic 
transmission  and  neuronal  excitability.  Several  lines  of   evidence  suggest  that  SGCs  have  bidirectional 
interactions with the neurons that they surround and with preganglionic nerve terminals. SGCs express 
ion  channels  (29),  which  provide  a  mechanism  for  regulation  of   the  extracellular  fluid  composition, 
receptors for neurotransmitters (30) and neurotrophic factors (31), and they are able to release media-
tors that affect neurons (23). Furthermore, active control of  the neuronal microenvironment by SGCs 
can contribute to disease (32). In the present study, we did not identify alterations in the distribution and 
arrangement  of   SGCs  in  stellate  ganglia;  however,  many  SGCs  exhibited  activation,  as  evidenced  by 
strong GFAP immunoreactivity. To our knowledge, this represents the first report of  glial activation in

stellate ganglia of  patients with CMY and arrhythmias. Taken together with the finding of  inflammation 
and oxidative stress within stellate ganglia, this finding suggests that SGNs in patients with CMY and 
arrhythmias are under pathologic stress. It is not clear whether SGCs are reacting to such stress to main-
tain homeostatic balance or whether they are contributing to it. However, in the context of  CMY, it is 
reasonable to speculate that SGC activation contributes to the pathophysiology. Systemic inflammation, 
a feature of  chronic CMY and heart failure, and regional inflammation have both been demonstrated to 
activate SGCs and augment coupling of  SGCs via gap junctions (33). Further, evidence has implicated 
increased coupling of  SGCs to neuronal hyperexcitability (31), which could be a key factor in the patho-
physiology of  ventricular tachycardia in CMY patients.

sentation depicting the impact of myocardial injury on stellate ganglion neurons, inducing the alterations identified in this work. CPN, cardiopulmonary nerve.

Stellate ganglia as nexus points for neuromodulation. These findings support the use of  denervation via partial 
resection of  the stellate ganglion to control arrhythmias (5, 34, 35) and to mitigate the progression of  dilated 
CMY (36). Pathological changes within stellate ganglia that act to enhance neurotransmission create further 
electrical instability (37), increasing the risk of  arrhythmias. Removal of  a segment of  the sympathetic chain 
may also eliminate these regions of  the nervous system, which can potentially amplify sympathoexcitation.
Limitations. Although the sample size is small, the use of  stellate ganglia from normal controls (nonca-
daveric) allowed uniform fixation across samples, which has not previously been performed. Further, entire 
ganglia were sectioned and studied for complete analyses. The small sample size prevented specific relation 
of  changes within ganglia to specific clinical or pathological features in patients. The age of  control and 
CMY subjects differed. This is unavoidable, as organ donors are typically young, healthy subjects. Ganglia 
from donors were typically harvested after cessation of  circulation; hence, it is conceivable that the lack of  
neutrophils within control ganglia is related to the lack of  circulation.

Conclusions.  In  summary,  our  study  demonstrates,  for  the  first  time  to  our  knowledge,  that  stellate 
ganglia from patients with CMY and arrhythmias exhibit oxidative stress, inflammation, neurochemical 
remodeling, and SGC activation (Figure 7). These findings suggest that stellate ganglion dysfunction is an 
important mediator of  enhanced sympathetic neurotransmission associated with arrhythmias and support 
cardiac sympathetic denervation as an important neuromodulatory intervention for arrhythmia control.

Methods

Specimen collection
CMY specimens. Stellate ganglia (n = 8) were collected from CMY patients undergoing cardiac sympa-
thetic denervation (the resection of  the lower half  of  the stellate ganglion, and second through fourth 
paravertebral ganglia). Patients consented to provide the excised stellate ganglia for research. Histology 
slides from another group of  8 CMY patients were also examined. These were patients with depressed 
left  ventricular  function  and  severe  ventricular  arrhythmias  refractory  to  pharmacologic  and  invasive

treatment strategies such as catheter ablation (Table 1). Detailed clinical information on these patients 
was  also  collected,  such  as  demographics,  medical  history,  and  records  of   noninvasive  and  invasive 
clinic  studies  and  assessments.  Following  excision,  stellate  ganglia  were  rapidly  collected  and  placed 
immediately in fixative, as described below.

Control specimens. Stellate ganglia (n = 8) were collected from organ donors at the time of  organ pro-
curement with consent provided for research tissue collection. Use of  these tissues was in accordance with 
institutional guidelines and was approved by the UCLA IRB. All available clinical information including 
age, gender, medical history, and cause of  death were reviewed. Patients with cardiac or pulmonary dis-
eases were excluded. Following removal of  the heart and lungs for transplantation, stellate ganglia were 
rapidly collected and placed immediately in fixative, as described.

Tissue sectioning and preparation
LSG  and  right  stellate  ganglia  (RSG)  were  evaluated.  Samples  were  placed  immediately  into  cold  10% 
phosphate-buffered formalin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 7 days, transferred to 70% ethanol, and subse-
quently embedded in paraffin.

Paraffin-embedded  ganglia  were  sectioned  at  5  μm  thickness  using  a  Microm  HM  310  microtome 
(Southeast Pathology). Sections were collected on charged slides, and prior to staining, they were deparaf-
finized by incubation at 58°C–60°C overnight followed by xylene washes and then rehydration in a graded 
ethanol series ending with water.

Histology
From  each  ganglion,  7–10  evenly  spaced  slides  were  stained  with  H&E.  These  slides  were  used  to 
identify  regions  containing  the  most  neurons,  neurons  containing  lipofuscin,  and  assess  leukocyte 
infiltration.

Immunohistochemistry
Antigen retrieval was performed using heated sodium citrate buffer (0.882 g per 300 ml distilled water, pH 
6.9, for 4 minutes), and washed 4 times in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.3). Sections were 
permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 (TX-100) in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 
then 1% H2O2 in PBS. Slides were washed again in PBS, and blocked for 2 hours in PBS containing 5% nor-
mal donkey serum, 0.5% BSA, and 0.4% TX-100. Slides were then incubated overnight at room tempera-
ture in blocking buffer containing primary antibodies, and subsequently washed in PBS, followed by block-
ing for 2 hours. Subsequent steps varied depending on the detection technique. For fluorescence detection, 
slides were incubated with AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Table 2) for 2 hours and washed 
with PBS. Cover glasses were applied using Citifour AF1 mounting medium (Ted Pella Inc.) and sealed. 
Kits containing species-specific biotinylated secondary antibodies were used for detection by the ABC tech-
nique (Vector Laboratories). Bright-field slides were then dehydrated and cover glasses were applied using 
Cytoseal XYL mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

CLINICAL MEDICINE 
Microscopy and image analysis
Slides  were  viewed  and  photographed  under  bright  field  or  fluorescence  illumination  using  an  Olympus 
BX41 microscope. Digital images were obtained using an Olympus Qcolor 3 camera. Select slides were fur-
ther examined using confocal microscopy with a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems Inc.).
For quantitative analysis of  lipofuscin-positive neurons and TH staining, we evaluated at least 3 sec-
tions from different levels within each ganglion and collected 6–7 images of  ×40 fields per section. Stereo 
Investigator software (MicroBrightField, Inc.) was used to identify and detect lipofuscin-positive neurons 
based on color. Staining of  neurons for TH was graded as intense, moderate, or absent. In each case, differ-
ent populations of  neurons were labeled with a unique marker in Stereo Investigator and counted.

TEM
Each specimen measured approximately 7 to 10 mm in length. Cross-sections, perpendicular to the length, 
were obtained. Efforts were made to obtain a uniform 1 × 1 mm specimen dimension per block. The tissue 
was fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 for 24 hours at 4°C, followed by 
1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer for 2 hours. Each case yielded 3–6 sections. Tissue 
sections were then infiltrated by progressive composite of  epon (1:1 to 3:1) in acetone and placed in embed-
ding molds (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 70166, block shape). One-micron-thick methylene blue–stained 
thick sections were prepared from each block and reviewed. The most representative block was selected and 
the area of  interest was designated for TEM grid preparation. The resin block was then trimmed and cut in 
90- to 120-nm thin sections and captured on TEM grids. These were stained with 4% uranyl acetate followed 
by lead citrate. The grids were allowed to dry in room temperature prior to examination in an FEI/PHILIPS 
EM208S transmission electron microscope. Multiple digital images at final print magnifications of  ×3,690 to 
×59,100 at 150 mm and direct magnification ranges of  ×2,000 to ×40,000 were captured.

Primary and secondary antibodies
A list of  the antibodies used and concentrations is provided in Table 2.

Statistics
Data are expressed as means ± SD. Continuous variables were compared using a 2-tailed Student’s t test or 
ANOVA for normally distributed variables, and the Mann-Whitney test for variables not distributed nor-
mally. An adjusted P value of  less than or equal to 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Study approval
The study was approved by the UCLA IRB. Written informed consent was provided by the patient or appro-
priate designee. For organ donors, consent for research was provided by the donor or appropriate signatory.
