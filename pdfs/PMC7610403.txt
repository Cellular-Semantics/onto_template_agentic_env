Abstract

Autonomous regulation of the intestine requires the combined activity of functionally distinct 
neurons of the enteric nervous system (ENS). However, the variety of enteric neuron types and 
how they emerge during development remain largely unknown. Here, we define a molecular 
taxonomy of twelve enteric neuron classes within the myenteric plexus of the mouse small 
intestine using single cell RNA-sequencing. We present cell-cell communication features, 
histochemical markers for motor, sensory, and interneurons together with transgenic tools for 
class-specific targeting. Transcriptome analysis of embryonic ENS uncovers a novel principle of 
neuronal diversification, where two neuron classes arise through a binary neurogenic branching, 
and all other identities emerge through subsequent post-mitotic differentiation. We identify generic 
and class-specific transcriptional regulators and functionally connect Pbx3 to a post-mitotic fate 
transition. Our results offer a conceptual and molecular resource for dissecting ENS circuits, and 
predicting key regulators for directed differentiation of distinct enteric neuron classes.

Introduction

Page 2

Within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the enteric nervous system (ENS) controls motility, 
blood flow and secretion, but also communicates with the immune system and the 
microbiome.1,2 These physiological processes rely on the combined activity of diverse 
enteric neuron types. Meticulous work over the last decades has identified a framework of 
enteric neurons with sensory (Intrinsic Primary Afferent Neurons, IPANs), motor or 
interneuron characteristics.3 Notably, only a few studies have focused on the mouse, despite 
its primary role as experimental model.4,5,6 To make ENS attainable to modern genetic 
technologies, the unique molecular signatures of the full range of mouse enteric neurons 
would be desirable. For instance, this could resolve whether the many functions of IPANs 
(first neurons in intrinsic reflex circuits) rely on subtypes with different properties, 
information that would help develop gut motility therapies targeting this neuron type.7

That functional diversity amongst enteric neurons is critical for physiological homeostasis is 
evidenced in several gut disorders where selective neuron types are affected (mainly NOS1+ 
neurons).8,9 Likewise, the absence of all enteric neurons in the distal bowel of Hirschsprung 
disease patients causes chronic constipation and requires surgical resection. Motivated by 
the lack of satisfactory treatments for enteric neuropathies, and spearheaded by the recent 
derivation of enteric neurons from human pluripotent stem cells10, efforts are now placed on 
developing reparative cell therapies.11 Potential approaches to repopulate ENS-deficient 
bowel segments include transplantation of in vitro-derived stem cells and steering of 
endogenous stem cells to neurons. In either case, complete functional recovery will depend 
on the success of recreating a correct cellular composition. This emphasizes the importance 
of acquiring a refined picture of the neuron subtypes that constitute the normal ENS, and 
how they specialize during development.

The ENS is mainly generated from vagal neural crest cells that colonize the foregut at 
embryonic day (E)9 and reach the hindgut at E14 where they converge with sacral-derived 
neural crest.12 Subsequently, Schwann cell precursors (SCPs), associated with extrinsic 
nerves, invade the gut wall and contribute to the ENS.13 Unlike the developing central 
nervous system (CNS), where neuron subtypes emerge at stereotypical positions from 
patterned zones of stem cells14, the ENS develops from highly motile streams of enteric 
stem cells.12 Phenotypically distinct neurons are generated at different embryonic time 
windows, suggesting a temporal mode of diversification.15,16 A comprehensive mapping of 
transcription and signaling regulators with temporo-spatially distinct expression has been 
carried out in the developing ENS, but lacked the refinement to describe neuron class 
lineages.17

In this study we optimized efficient capture of enteric neurons for single-cell transcriptomics 
and evidence a novel taxonomy of 12 myenteric neuron classes of the mouse small intestine, 
including motor, inter- and sensory neuron types, greatly expanding and refining our earlier 
characterisation.18 The enteric neuron classes (ENCs) are defined by their communication 
features, which we portray along with immunohistochemical markers and transgenic tools 
for immediate use in experimental neuroscience. Based on further transcriptome analysis of 
the developing ENS we postulate a new logic for enteric neuron diversification where

myenteric ENC identities are generated from an initial binary difference at neurogenesis that 
successively diverge at the post-mitotic state. The principle is supported by the identification 
of the transcription factor PBX3 that regulate the transition of post-mitotic inhibitory 
ENC8/9 to excitatory ENC12 neurons.

Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals 12 Enteric Neuron Classes in the myenteric plexus of 
the mouse small intestine

We have previously reported single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of myenteric plexus 
isolated from the small intestine of Wnt1-Cre;R26R-Tomato juvenile mice, yielding 1105 
neurons classified into nine clusters. We suspected that the number of neurons was 
insufficient to represent the full range neuronal diversity of the ENS. Seeking to enrich 
neuron proportion, we investigated whether the recently described pan-neuronal Baf53b-Cre 
line19 specifically and efficiently labels enteric neurons, when crossed with R26R-Tomato 
reporter mice. We quantified co-expression of TOM with the neuron marker HUC/D and the 
enteric glia markers SOX2/10 in myenteric plexus across the small intestine. We found that 
all TOM+ cells expressed HUC/D whereas none expressed SOX2/10 (Fig. 1a). Likewise, the 
vast majority of HUC/D+ cells expressed TOM (~98%; Fig 1b). An improved protocol for 
cell dissociation was applied on the myenteric plexus from the small intestine of Baf53b-
Cre;R26R-Tomato juvenile mice (postnatal day (P)21), TOM+ cells were sorted by flow 
cytometry and single cells analyzed by 10 x Chromium RNA-sequencing (Fig. 1c).

ENC: Enteric Neuron Class; FC: Fold Change; MN: Motor neuron; IN: Interneuron; UMI: 
Unique Molecular Identifiers; UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection

Of 9,141 cells captured we retained those with 600 total unique molecular identifier (UMI) 
counts to assess the proportion of neurons in the dataset (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 1a). 
More than 90% of the recovered cells corresponded to enteric neurons, compared to only 
10% from Wnt1-Cre;R26R-Tomato mice18 (Fig. 1e). We employed iterative clustering with 
increasingly restrictive quality control thresholding, and removed low-quality, non-neuronal 
and ambiguous cells. 4,892 high quality enteric neurons were used for unsupervised graph-
based clustering, yielding 12 enteric neuron classes (ENCs) with similar contribution from 
both sexes (Fig. 1f; Extended Data Fig. 1b-d). Note that our new classification confirmed 4 
of the previously found clusters, re-defined 6 clusters and identified 2 new distinct clusters 
(Extended Data Fig. 1e).

We discovered the most highly enriched genes in each class (Fig. 1g, Supplementary Table 
1, Supplementary Fig. 1). Notably, some classes were defined by the selective expression of 
single genes with likely importance for their neuronal activity. These included ENC5 
(somatostatin; Sst), ENC6 (neuromedin U; Nmu), ENC7 (cholecystokinin; Cck and 
urocortin 3; Ucn3), ENC10 (neuronal differentiation 6; Neurod6) and ENC12 
(neurexophilin-2; Nxph2). Other classes were distinguished by combinatorial gene codes 
(Fig. 1g). ENC1-4 displayed a partly shared gene expression, including Tac1, but differed in 
their expression of Calb2, Ndufa4l2, Gda, Penk and Fut9 (Extended Data Fig. 2a). ENC8-9 
jointly expressed Nos1 and c1ql1, but Npy and Cox8b were significantly lower in ENC9. 
ENC11 highly expressed Npy, but lacked Nos1 (Extended Data Fig. 2b).

We next sought to relate our new ENS classification to previously discovered characteristics 
of functional enteric neuron types. To this end, we gathered phenotypic marker codes from 
previous immunohistochemical studies,4,5,6 performed probabilistic cell type assignment 
(Fig. 1h, Extended Data Fig. 2c) and regrouped according to the ENCs. The ENCs generally 
consisted of cells with the same functional type (Fig. 1h,i). ENC1-4 were assigned to 
excitatory motor neurons (Tac1/Calb2), while ENC8 and 9 matched inhibitory motor 
neurons (Nos1/Gal/Vip/Npy). ENC6, 7 and 12 were mapped to IPANs and expressed

different combinations of previously defined markers (Calca/Calcb/Nfem/Calb1/Calb2). 
These plausible IPANs were clearly separable by their selective expression of Nmu, 
Ucn-3/Cck or Nxph2. The IPAN identity of ENC6 and subsets of ENC12 was confirmed, 
while ENC7 likely have different functions (See analysis in Fig. 4). ENC10 was assigned to 
Interneuron (IN)1, and was, contrary to most enteric neurons, both nitrergic (Nos1) and 
cholinergic (Slc18a3; Chat detection level overall low18). ENC5 expressed Sst/Calcb/Calb2 
and was mapped to IN2. Characteristics of serotonergic IN3, (Ddc, Slc18a2, Slc6a4, Fig. 1h; 
Extended Data Fig. 2d,e) were detected in a subset of ENC12 cells.

Gene profiles signified several additional neuroregulatory substances with class-specific 
expression. vGlut2 and Gad2 expression suggested glutamatergic (ENC7,12) and 
GABAergic (ENC10) phenotypes (Fig. 1g,j). ENC11 expressed Dbh and Th, key enzymes in 
the noradrenaline biosynthesis (Fig. 1g,j), but lacked Ddc.

Enteric Neuron Classes are defined by their unique communication features

Synaptic input-output communication represents a fundamental distinction among neuron 
types and is determined by connectivity, responsiveness, and release of neurotransmitters/
peptides.20 We explored gene families that control these functions and found differential 
expression between the ENCs (Fig. 2a-d; Supplementary Fig. 2). Responsiveness to enteric 
neurotransmitters/peptides appeared class-specific. For example, glutamate receptor Grm5 
was selectively expressed in ENC7, while somatostatin receptor Sstr5 was limited to ENC12 
(Fig. 2a). Distinct expression of many cell signaling molecules with unknown functions in 
the mature ENS (e.g. Kit, Bdnf) was also detected amongst ENCs. Notably, ENC6 
selectively expressed signaling factors/modulators recently linked to enteric control of 
immune cells (Nmu and the BMP inhibitor Nog)21–23 (Fig. 1g, Supplementary Fig. 2b). Ion 
channels showed class-specific distribution likely reflecting unique electrophysiological 
properties (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Fig. 2e). ENC6 expressed Kcnn3 and Ano2, described in 
sensory transduction7,24, while ENC12 expressed the mechanosensory channel Piezo2 25, 
further supporting sensory identities of these two classes. ENCs also displayed unique 
combinations of adhesion molecules (e.g. semaphorins and ephrins) that may determine their 
precise connectivity patterns (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Fig. 2d). Of notice, neurexophilins 
(Nxph1-4), modulators of synaptic plasticity26, displayed almost mutually exclusive 
expression patterns. Taken together, the selective expression of genes conferring neuronal 
properties strongly supports that ENC1-12 represent functionally distinct neurons.

Gene profiles conferring neuronal characters result from fine-tuned transcriptional programs. 
We found that each ENC were distinguishable by its combinatorial set of transcription 
factors, for example ENC10 (Neurod6) and ENC12 (Pbx3, Onecut2)) (Fig. 2d; 
Supplementary Fig. 2c). ENC6 showed the most distinct profile and was the only class that 
lacked Phox2a. Etv1 and Bnc2 were expressed across several ENCs but with a 
complementary pattern, possibly reflecting early developmental divisions (Fig. 2d,e).

To identify additional gene families that define ENC identities, we assessed HGNC (HUGO 
Gene Nomenclature Committee) gene-sets curated by Paul et al (2017)20 in our ENCs 
(Supplementary Table 2). The majority of enriched gene families could be classified 
according to their transcription, adhesion and signaling activities (Fig. 2f,g). We also found 
15% of the high-ranking gene-sets to have “membrane trafficking” properties, including the 
relatively unexplored copines27 and annexins28 (Fig. 2h, Supplementary Fig. 2f). Thus, 
proteins organizing membrane distribution of receptors/channels/vesicles may contribute to 
neuron subtype specific features.

Identification of immunohistochemical markers for Enteric Neuron Classes

To validate the existence of enteric neuron classes in vivo we performed 
immunohistochemistry in the mouse small intestine and included both positive (Fig. 3) and 
negative markers (Extended Data Fig. 3) for all ENCs. A total of 23 proteins were analysed 
with respect to our newly defined ENCs. Several antibodies for the same antigen and ENC 
were assessed to ensure faithful histochemical reagents for individual ENCs (Supplementary 
Table 3). Of notice, proteins previously not linked to distinct enteric neuron subtypes in the 
mouse ENS were detected including NDUFA4L2 (ENC1-3), FUT9 (ENC4), UCN3 (ENC7), 
NEUROD6 (ENC10), and NXPH2 (ENC12). Their expression was found in the context of a 
combinatorial marker code (See Extended Data Fig. 3p for a summary table). For instance, 
NEUROD6 co-expressed NOS1 and NF-M (Fig. 3, ENC10) but never co-appeared with 
CALR (Extended Data Fig. 3l). We furthermore quantified the relative proportion of ENCs 
across the small intestine in 9-12 weeks C57/B6 mice (Extended Data Figure 3q).

Analysis of protein expression enabled the additional study of neurotransmitters, which are 
catalytic amino acid products and therefore not detectable in transcriptomes. Of notice, 5-
HT (serotonin) was identified in a subset of ENC12 neurons (Fig. 3) as suggested from the 
cell assignment (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e). The analysis also supported GABAergic (GAD2) 
and glutamatergic (VGLUT2) phenotypes (Fig. 1j, Fig. 3). See Extended Data Fig. 4 for 
schematic tables contrasting the ENC gene expression patterns.

ENC6 and subsets of ENC12 neurons show morphological and projectional IPAN traits

We chose to further investigate the three predicted IPANs (ENC 6,7 and 12) given the key 
functions enteric neurons with sensory abilities are expected to play in gut physiology7 (Fig. 
1h,j). Immunohistochemical identification of ENC6 and ENC7 by their most specific 
markers was possible but not robust (Fig. 3), and we therefore acquired Nmu-Cre and Cck-
IRES-Cre mice. Both transgenic lines were initially crossed to R26R-Tomato mice. Using 
RNAscope® we determined that 95.8±2.9% of Nmu + cells were labelled with TOM and that 
93.2±1.6% of TOM+ cells expressed Nmu, confirming the efficiency and specificity of 
Nmu-Cre;R26R-Tomato mice (Extended Data Fig. 5a,d,e). In contrast, Cck-IRES-
Cre;R26R-Tomato mice showed wide-spread TOM labelling in both enteric neurons and glia 
(Extended Data Fig. 5b), likely due to transient embryonic Cck expression17. To target Cck + 
neurons, we instead injected Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV-PHP-S)29 carrying an inducible 
reporter (DIO-EYFP or DIO-Ruby3) into Cck-IRES-Cre mice. Reporter expression 
specifically labelled Cck + neurons (95.8±4.1% of EYFP cells; Extended Data Fig. 5c-e). To 
detect ENC12 we used NTNG1 and CALB (validated in Fig. 3).

We first assessed the IPAN markers CGRP, NF-M and CALB protein expression as scRNA-
seq indicated differential expression in the three putative IPAN classes (Fig. 1g). CGRP 
marked most ENC6 neurons, but was not readily detectable in ENC7 and 12 (Fig. 4a-d). NF-
M was most prominent in ENC12 (100%), but also detected in the majority of ENC6 and 
ENC7. CALB (defined as marker of ENC12) was only found in a minor proportion of ENC6 
and ENC7. In conclusion, previous IPAN markers formed the following combinatorial 
codes: ENC6 (CALB- CGRP+ NF-M+/-), ENC7 (CALB+/- CGRP- NF-M+/-), and ENC12 
(CALB+ CGRP- NF-M+).

IPANs are thought to mainly correspond to cells with Dogiel Type II morphology, defined as 
large, smooth cell body with multiple axons.30,31 However, uni-axonal filamentous neurons 
have also been attributed mechanosensory functions in the guinea pig.32 ENC6 neurons 
classified as Type II (Fig. 4e,h,i; Extended Data Fig. 6a). ENC7 neurons were either Dogiel 
Type I (lamellar dendrites and one discernible axon)30 or what we termed “Simple”, having 
round or oval cell bodies and one (sometimes two) axons (Fig. 4f,h,I; Extended Data Fig. 
6a). ENC12 morphologies displayed remarkable heterogeneity; we found Type I, “Simple”, 
Filamentous, and a population with large lamellar cytoplasmic extension, here termed “LL” 
(Fig. 4g-I, Extended Data Fig. 6a).

Given the first position of IPANs in the peristaltic circuit, they connect to interneurons and 
motor neurons within the myenteric plexus but do not innervate the external muscle layers. 
While axons from the three ENCs were readily observed in the myenteric plexus plane (Fig. 
4j-l), none were identified within the circular muscle (Fig. 4m-o). In contrast, extensive 
axonal tracts for inhibitory (NOS1+) and excitatory (ENK+, CALR+) motor neurons were 
found in proximity to Interstitial Cells of Cajal (ANO1+) in the circular muscle plane (Fig. 
4p). Thus, we concluded that ENC 6, 7, and 12 are not motor neurons.

Another distinguishing feature of IPANs is their projection to the submucosa and mucosa. 
On transverse tissue sections, we found NMU+ axons intersecting the circular muscle (Fig. 
4q). Projections in the villi were also detected, which possibly have a mixed origin also

emanating from NMU+ submucosal neurons. In contrast, CCK+ axons and NTNG1/CALB+ 
axons were only observed in the myenteric plexus and not in the muscle or villi (Fig. 4r,s).

In conclusion, our study identified ENC6 as Type II IPANs and with that the Nmu-Cre 
mouse strain as a useful tool to further study and modulate this important enteric neuron 
type. The particular morphology displayed by a subset of ENC12 neurons and the 
expression of PIEZO2 (Figs. 2b, 3) connects these cells to the reported filamentous IPANs. 
Our analysis indicated that ENC7 do not correspond to bona fide IPANs, despite their 
expression of NF-M and CALB. Thus, previously used IPAN markers cannot faithfully 
discriminate IPANs from other neuron types.

Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals transcriptional programs of generic cell states of the 
developing ENS

To understand the generic and specific differentiation processes underlying the formation of 
ENC1-12 we performed scRNA-seq of the whole ENS isolated from Wnt1Cre-R26RTomato 
small intestine at E15.5 and E18.5, when most myenteric neuron types are generated.15,16

A total of ~3000-3500 cells were captured per stage. After removal of unhealthy, ambiguous 
or non-ENS cells (Supplementary Fig. 3, Extended Data Fig. 7a,b), the remaining cells 
(3260 for E15.5 and 2733 for E18.5) were subjected to clustering and coordinated gene 
pattern analysis. An overall similar manifold (UMAP, Uniform Manifold Approximation and 
Projection) was observed at the two stages (Fig. 5a,b; Extended Data Fig. 7c-f). The enteric 
progenitor/glial marker Sox10 (Fig. 5c) was used to assign clusters corresponding to 
progenitor cells within different parts of the cell cycle (Fig. 5d), while Elavl4HIGH 
expression (Fig. 5c) demarcated differentiating (maturing) neurons. An Ascl1 HIGH cluster at 
the intersection of the two was considered to correspond to cells undergoing the transitory 
phase of neurogenesis (here termed neuroblasts). While glial differentiation occurs early33, 
we only observed clear clusters corresponding to glia (Plp1 high; S100bhigh) at E18.5 (Fig. 
5b). The two populations appeared to be the previously reported Schwann cell precursors 
(SCPs) that contribute to the ENS at perinatal stages13 (SCP markers: Dhh, Mal and Mpz; 
mousebrain.org), and vagal neural crest-derived enteric glia (enteric glia markers: Apoe, 
Nkain4; mousebrain.org). To investigate the cell differentiation dynamics, we performed 
RNA velocity analysis (Fig. 5e), which confirmed the overall direction from progenitors to 
maturing neurons. The strongest transcriptional change appeared to occur at the neuroblast 
stage (indicated by long arrows), while cells at the branch “tips” seemed to approach a 
differentiated steady-state (short arrows).

Projection; ENC: Enteric Neuron Class; GP15: Gene Pattern at E15.5.

Differential expression analysis and coordinated gene patterns (Supplementary Fig. 4; 
Supplementary Tables 4,5) of these broad cell states were used to discover transcription and 
signaling genes with likely functions in stem cell maintenance (Mef2c, Sox5/8, Notch1/2; 
Fig. 5f), neurogenesis (Dll3, Hes6; Fig. 5g), neuron differentiation (Myt1l, Ptprn; Fig. 5h), 
SCP (Gfra3, Wnt6; Fig. 5i) and enteric glia (Hes5, Frzb; Fig. 5i). The Notch signaling 
pathway appeared strongly implicated in ENS development given the differential expression 
of its molecular components across cell states (Extended Data Fig. 8). Neuroblasts displayed 
enriched expression of various epigenetic modifiers (Rcor2, Bcl11b; Extended Data Fig. 9) 
likely to execute the observed vast transcriptional change (Fig. 5g) at neurogenesis.

Enteric Neuron Classes are formed through a binary fate split at neurogenesis followed by 
successive diversification at the post-mitotic stage

UMAP of ENS at E15.5 and E18.5 showed that enteric neurons are formed through two 
trajectories, which we termed BranchA and BranchB. On these branches, we sought to 
locate cells that have acquired traits of ENC1-12. By searching for shared overlap of mutual 
neighbors in projected principal component analysis (PCA) space, class identifiers were 
assigned by a weigh vote classifier, giving a prediction score for each ENC on the 
developmental data. Mapping of transferred identities with predicted score >0.5 onto the 
trajectories indicated that ENC8-12 are generated through BranchA, while ENC1-7 
differentiate in BranchB (Fig. 6a-d; Supplementary Fig. 5). ENC5 and ENC11 likely emerge 
mainly postnatally, although some cells scored high for these identities when analyzed 
individually (Fig. 6d). Notably, the branching split point coincided with ENC8 and ENC1 
identities (Fig. 6c). Differential expression analysis of fine clusters (Extended Data Fig. 7e,f; 
Supplementary Table 6) further corroborated the mapping and identified Gal/Vip/Nos1 
(ENC8,9) and Ndufa4l2 (ENC1/2) within early branches (Fig. 6e). Within BranchA, traits 
corresponding to ENC10 (Neurod6) and ENC12 (Ntng1, Calb1, Nxph2) gradually appeared 
(Fig. 6e). ENC10-12 identities formed through a nitrergic-to-cholinergic switch (Nos1 
down- and Slc18a2 up-regulated; Fig. 6e). The generation of ENC10 at the intersection of 
this process could therefore explain the mixed nitrergic/cholinergic identity of this neuron 
type (Fig. 1g). BranchB diverged further into BranchB1, corresponding to emergence of 
ENC3/4 (Gda, Fut9) or BranchB2, corresponding to ENC6 (Ano2) and ENC7 (Mgat4c, 
Ucn3).

clusters corresponding to ENC4, 6 and 7 are more distinct. Several more marker genes of 
juvenile ENCs picked from Supplementary Table 1 are shown: Ass1 and Gng8 (ENC8/9); 
Gna14 (ENC12); Nxph4 (ENC2/3, but not ENC4); Prkcb (ENC2/3/4, but not ENC6/7) 
Tmeff2 and Ntrk3 (ENC6/7), Cbln2 (ENC6) and Mgat4c/Kcna5 (ENC7). UMAP: Uniform 
Manifold Approximation and Projection; ENC: Enteric Neuron Class; PAGA: Partition-
based graph abstraction; iMN: inhibitory motor neuron; eMN: excitatory motor neuron. 
IPAN: Intrinsic Primary Afferent Neuron; IN: Interneuron.

We screened for transcription factors that could define the two branches and their 
differentiation into ENCs. A pattern of Etv1/Ebf1/Tbx3 and Bnc2/Dlx5 marked the early 
trajectories of BranchA and BranchB, respectively. Those transcription factors either 
remained in the full branch (Etv1) or were suppressed in the process of differentiation (Ebf1) 
(Fig. 6f, Extended Data Fig. 10b,c). Thus, the complementary expression of Etv1 and Bnc2 
in juvenile ENCs (see Fig. 2e) indeed reflects a developmental binary fate choice. Most 
transcription factors formed combinatorial codes that mirrored their juvenile expression (e.g. 
Neurod6, Onecut2), while a minority displayed broader developmental expression (Zfp804a, 
Trps1) (Fig. 6f; see also Extended Data Fig. 10; compare with Fig. 2d and Supplementary 
Fig. 2c). Transcription factors with transient expression in development were also discovered 
(Etv4, Dlx5; Extended Data Fig. 10c), and may function in neuron diversification, but not 
cell identity maintenance.

To investigate gene expression along developmental trajectories, we defined partition-based 
graph abstraction (PAGA) representation of E15.5 and E18.5 data (Fig. 6g). PAGA coupled 
with diffusion pseudotime analysis confirmed the gradual differentiation of ENCs within 
BranchA, BranchB1 and B2 (Fig. 6h). Thus, the 12 ENCs appear not to be generated from 
own stem cell pools. Instead, proliferating progenitors undertake only two prototypic traits 
similar to ENC1 or ENC8 upon completing neurogenesis (excitatory and inhibitory motor 
neurons; Fig. 6c). Subsequently, many neurons mature within their first identity, while others 
downregulate their specific markers and convert into new classes (ENC2-7; ENC9-12).

The ENC8/9 to ENC12 phenotypic switch depends on PBX3 expression

As nitrergic neurons (NOS1+) are of particular clinical importance8,9, we decided to focus 
on the gradual diversification within BranchA. We noted a border between ENC8/9 and 
ENC12 (Fig. 6a), coinciding with opposing expression of Gal/Vip/Nos1 relative to Ntng1/

Nfem/Calb1 (Fig. 6e; Fig. 7a). Given the differentiation direction indicated by RNA velocity 
(Fig. 5e), neurons obtaining early ENC8/9 traits thus appear to convert into ENC12 neurons. 
Notably, Pbx3 expression correlated with the transition point (Figs. 7a). We have previously 
reported PBX3+ enteric neurons both in mouse and human embryonic gut that express 
CALB, but not NOS1.17 Quantification at E18.5 revealed that only 1.5±0.4% (n=3) of the 
NOS1+ neurons expressed PBX3, and those displayed low NOS1 levels. This expression 
dynamics suggests that the ENC8/9 identity may be negatively regulated by PBX3.

To evaluate the role of Pbx3 in ENS development, we analyzed the guts of Pbx3-/- mutant 
mice. As Pbx3-/- mutant mice die within hours after birth,34 we focused our analysis at 
E15.5-E18.5. We first investigated if the proliferative capacity of ENS cells was affected in 
Pbx3-/- mutant mice. The ratio of SOX10+ cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle, 
incorporating the nucleoside analog EdU after a 90 min pulse, was the same in mutant and 
control guts at E15.5 (Fig. 7b). Moreover, the ratio of HUC/D+ cells to SOX10+ cells was 
unchanged in the mutant compared to control guts (Fig. 7c). Thus, the loss of Pbx3 does not 
impact generic programs of enteric proliferation or neurogenesis.

The correlation between Pbx3 expression in emerging ENC12 neurons bordering ENC8/9 
neurons prompted us to determine the percentage of HUC/D+ neurons expressing the 
ENC8/9 markers GAL, NOS1 and VIP and the ENC12 marker CALB at E18.5. We found a 
significant increase in the proportion of neurons expressing VIP (20.5%), NOS1 (28.7%) 
and GAL (37.1%) (Fig. 7d,e), while the ratio of CALB+ neurons was decreased by 43.8% 
(Fig. 7d,e) in Pbx3-/- mutants compared to control guts. Thus, our data suggest that PBX3 
suppresses the ENC8/9 phenotype and allows or induces differentiation of the ENC12 
identity. In the absence of PBX3, neurons fail to differentiate efficiently into CALB+ ENC12 
neurons and mature instead into GAL+/VIP+/NOS+ neurons (Fig. 7f). ENC7 neurons also 
express PBX3 (Fig. 6f), and we found that they too were reduced in Pbx3-/- mutant mice 
(ratio of neurons expressing CCK was decreased by 72,1±1,43%; n=4 mouse pairs). These 
data support a post-mitotic cell diversification model, where initial branch-specific gene 
expression is repressed in a process of cell identity conversion to achieve neuron subtype 
heterogeneity.

Discussion

Page 20

The neuronal composition of murine ENS and how it emerges during development have not 
been determined in detail. This study provides a new taxonomy of small intestine myenteric 
neurons and a novel principle of their embryonic diversification.

A novel molecular classification of myenteric neurons in the mouse small intestine

We present a pan-neuronal mouse line, Baf53b-Cre, that allow specific and efficient 
capturing of ENS neurons. We define 12 classes of myenteric ENS neurons, (ENCs) and 
suggest their basic functional assignment. Although previously IPAN markers were found 
within three ENCs, our characterization of morphology and projections suggest that sensory 
neurons may only correspond to ENC6 and a subset of ENC12, having immunoregulatory or 
mechanosensory properties, respectively. The validated genetic mouse tool (Nmu-Cre) and 
stringent markers (NTNG1/CALB), together with cell-cell communication profiles could 
help to refine the definition of different types of enteric neurons with sensory abilities and 
determine possible additional interneuron characteristics. We do not rule out that other 
ENCs (or subsets within) form additional atypical IPAN types, including ENC7. A plausible 
alternative role of ENC7 is viscerofugal, as CCK expression is associated with this neuron 
type in the guinea pig.3 Our molecular classification of motor neurons is in agreement with 
the previous major division into inhibitory and excitatory types3, and we also identified 
plausible subtypes (ENC1-3 and ENC8-9, respectively). ENC5 and ENC10 were assigned as 
suggested interneurons, but knowledge of these neuron types is limited. ENC4 and 11 
appeared as rare neuron types with unique expression patterns. Further functional dissections 
of these four classes could be aided by transgenic mice driven by herein identified marker 
genes. 5-HT was associated with several morphological types within the heterogeneous 
ENC12 class (Extended Data Fig. 6b), possibly reflecting additional functions beyond 
interneurons, as recently suggested.35 Note also that enteric neuron identities may be 
different at other regions including the stomach.

A novel model for cell diversification in the developing ENS

Although cell proliferation, migration and survival are well understood processes within the 
developing ENS12, neuronal diversification has received little attention17,36. In contrast, 
gene regulatory programs driving neuronal subtype differentiation in the developing CNS 
have been comprehensively resolved.37 This lag of knowledge in ENS development may 
stem from the fundamentally different ways in which these nervous systems are formed. In 
the neural tube, the differentiation of committed progenitors into specified neuron subtypes 
occurs at stereotypical positions (Fig. 8a), making studies of gene regulatory networks 
attainable.14 In the developing gut, progenitor cells and differentiating neurons are 
intermingled in seemingly stochastic manners, and the motile behavior of progenitors38 is 
likely to perturb morphogens to set up stable differentiation programs based on position. 
Instead, a temporal mechanism has been the suggested dominant mode of specification 
within the developing ENS. Birth-dating studies signify that the neurogenic peak of different 
neurons occurs at different developmental timepoints.15,16 The present study puts forward a 
new model of enteric neuron specification (Fig. 8b). We show that primitive features of only 
two subsets of enteric neuron subclasses (ENC1 and ENC8) are generated as dividing

progenitors undergo neurogenesis. Subsequent identity conversions appear to underlie 
formation of ENC2-7 and ENC9-12. Thus, the twelve ENCs are generated from an initial 
binary difference, which become further diversified at the post-mitotic state. In support, 
neurons start expressing CGRP and 5-HT, here mapped to ENC6 and ENC12 (Figs. 3, 4a), 
4-6 days (E17-18)36 after they are born16. Furthermore, neurons labelled between E11.5 and 
E16.5 have single long processes39, indicating that Dogiel Type II neurons (ENC6) develop 
at later stages. A sequential differentiation process within already post-mitotic neurons was 
also indicated by our previous gene expression resource of the developing ENS17, which 
showed a greater diversity of transcription and signaling factors in neurons than in dividing 
progenitors. The developing ENS thus relies on flexible postnatal neurons, a principle that 
might explain how neuronal complexity can be formed without spatially defined stem cell 
populations and during a protracted time (until P30)40.

Figure 8. Schematic representation of the major principle of neuronal diversification in the 
developing CNS versus ENS.
a) Progenitor cells within the neural tube are patterned according to their position within the 
coordinates of morphogenetic cues. The transcription factor codes (depicted by different 
colors) of each progenitor is decoded into different neuron class identities at neurogenesis. 
Further maturation leads to neuronal heterogeneity within each major neuron class. 
Temporal specification mechanisms (important in telencephalon and ventral 
myelencephalon) are not accounted for here. b) In contrast to progenitors within the neural 
tube, ENS progenitor cells are migratory and therefore lack distinct positional identities. A 
binary heterogeneity is apparent in neuroblasts undergoing their last cell cycle, resulting in 
post-mitotic neurons with traits of ENC1 or ENC8. Immature neurons either differentiate 
into these prototypic classes, or differentiate further in a gradual diversification process 
where the initial features are downregulated and replaced by other transcriptional programs 
generating ENC2-7 and ENC9-12. Picture depicts the plausible branching process, but 
future interrogation is needed to resolve the trajectory of each ENC in detail. CNS: Central 
Nervous System; ENS: Enteric Nervous System; ENC: Enteric Neuron Class.

The two major branch identities must, however, already be segregated in progenitors 
undergoing their last cell-cycle, as a previous Confetti-based lineage-tracing study showed 
that clones consisting of 2-4 cells, traced at E12.5 and analyzed in adulthood, never

contained both NOS1+ (ENC8-10; Branch A) and CALR+ (ENC1,2,5,6; Branch B) neurons.
33 The subsequent conversions of ENC1 or ENC8 traits are associated with switching of a 
number of critical phenotypic genes. As part of the ENC8/9 to ENC12 conversion, 
Nos1/Gal/Vip is suppressed and Calb1 is upregulated, a process critically dependent on 
PBX3. Transient expression of NOS1 is supported by an earlier study which determined that 
the birth-wave of NOS1+ neurons commence at E12.5, although NOS1+ neurons already can 
be observed at E11.5.16 Thus, even though ENC8/9 and ENC12 are generated from the same 
birth branch, ENC12 could represent neurons that are born at early developmental time 
points and switch class, while later born neurons retain their ENC8/9 identity. Such model 
would make our data consistent with studies showing a correlation between birth date and 
cell identity15,16. Like most studies on ENS development, we focused on the small intestine 
and cannot rule out that other principles might prevail at other gut regions.

Impact on future regenerative medicine for enteric neuropathies

Several primary enteric neuropathies mainly affect NOS1+ neurons including esophageal 
achalasia and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. NOS1+ neurons are also damaged in Chagas 
disease and diabetic gastroparesis.8,9 These neurons may be especially susceptible to 
damage due to the reaction between free radical nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species in 
stressed tissue.9 Esophageal achalasia has been pointed out as plausible first disease for cell-
based therapies as its neural deficit is well defined within a small tissue area.11 Our study 
provides knowledge that could aid in the specific engineering of nitrergic neurons including 
the embryonic generation of nitrergic motor neurons (ENC8/9), early nitrergic marker genes 
and a negative transcriptional regulator (PBX3). The identified neurogenic program could 
further aid in efforts to convert enteric glia to neurons. Thus, with further functional 
interrogation of the herein identified transcription factors, selective production of NOS1+ 
neurons is likely conceivable following the same principle used to make various types of 
brain neurons41,42.

Methods

Mice

The generation of the Baf53b-Cre 19 (JAX, #027826), Cck-Ires-Cre 43 (JAX, #12706), Nmu-
Cre (MMMRC, 036643-UCD), and Wnt1-Cre 44 mouse strains have been previously 
described. Strains were crossed with Ai14 45 (R26RTomato; JAX #007908). Pbx3+/- mice 
were kindly provided by C. Villaescusa (Karolinska Institutet) and have been described34. 
Pbx3+/- and Baf53b-Cre mice were kept on a C57BL/6 background. Animals were group-
housed, with food and water ad libitum, under 12-h light-dark cycle conditions, 22°C 
ambient temperature and 50% humidity. Animal experiments were approved by the local 
ethics committee in northern Stockholm (Stockholm Norra djurfo?rso?ksetiska na?mnd, 
Jordbruksverket) (N87/13 and 5264/18).

Tissue preparation for single cell RNA sequencing

Juvenile tissue preparation—A total of four Baf53b-Cre;R26RTomato mice (2 females, 
2 males), postnatal day (P)21, were used for single cell RNA-sequencing. During all stages 
of the dissociation protocol, the tissue was kept in dissection solution: TRIS-HEPES

recovery solution containing 76 mM Tris HCl, 19.5 mM Tris Base, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM 
NaH2PO4, 30 mM NaHCO3, 20 mM glucose, 5 mM sodium ascorbate, 3 mM sodium 
pyruvate, 0.5 mM CaCl2 and 10 MgSO4 (pH 7.3-7.4). The dissection solution was 
equilibrated in 95% O2, 5% CO2 for 30 min before the start of the experiment and held on 
ice at all steps. The dissected small intestines were cut in 5 cm pieces and each segment 
flushed inside with ice-cold dissection solution. The mesentery was removed and intestine 
pieces opened lengthwise along the mesenteric border. The tissue pieces were pinned with 
the mucosa side down on a Sylgaard (Dow Corning) covered dissection dish on top of an 
ice-block. The smooth muscle layers, containing the myenteric plexus were peeled off from 
the submucosa using watchmaker forceps and stored in dissection solution on ice until all 
pieces were peeled. Peels were cut in 2-5 mm2 pieces and placed in 5 ml digestion solution 
(0.75 mg/ml Liberase TH Research grade (Roche), 0.1 mg/ml DNAseI (Sigma-Aldrich) and 
25U/ml Dispase (Corning)) in DMEM/F12 at 37°C for 30 minutes, with gentle shaking of 
the tube every 10 min. After completed digestion, enzyme mixture was replaced with 2.5% 
bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich), 5mM EDTA in ice-cold DMEM/F12. Tissue 
pieces were triturated using three fire-polished Pasteur pipettes with decreasing opening size 
(from ~70% to 10% of the original opening size) that had been coated with 1% BSA 
solution, and then filtered through a DMEM/F12-equilibrated 30 μm cell strainer (Miltenyi 
Biotec). Single cells were collected by centrifugation at 120g for 5 min at 4°C. The pellet 
was resuspended in 2 ml DPBS solution, 1% BSA and 1% DRAQ7 (Biostatus). Tomato+ 
cells were sorted by flow cytometry (see Supplementary Fig. 6 for representative plots) on a 
BD Influx™ cell sorter and collected in ice-cold PBS containing 0.04% BSA. 2,91% of total 
singlets were captured (45 631 cells) and used for single cell RNA-sequencing. The gating 
of cells was performed on BD FACS Software v. 1.0.0.650.

Embryonic tissue preparation—Embryonic day (E) 0,5 was considered when vaginal 
plug was seen in female mice. Wnt1-Cre;R26Tomato were used for single cell RNA 
sequencing experiments. In total 5 and 3 embryos at E15.5 and E18.5 respectively, were 
used and for each developmental stage the small intestines were pooled. During all stages of 
the dissociation protocol the tissue was kept in DMEM/F12 medium (Invitrogen) on ice, 
except where mentioned otherwise. Dissection steps were carried out under a stereo 
microscope. The mesentery was removed, the small intestines were cut into 2-5mm2 pieces 
and put into digestion solution (0.75mg/ml Liberase TH Research Grade (Roche), 12 U/ml 
Dispase, 0.1mg/ml and DNAseI (Sigma) in DMEM/F12) at 37°C for 10 min (E15.5) or 20 
min (E18.5) with shaking every 5 min. The enzyme mixture was replaced with DMEM/F12 
medium containing 2% BSA and 5mM EDTA. The cells were then manually triturated using 
3 fire-polished Pasteur pipettes with decreasing opening size (from ~70% to 10% of the 
original opening size) that were previously coated with 1% BSA solution for at least 1h at 
RT. The single cell suspension was filtered through a DMEM/F12-equilibrated 30μm cell 
strainer (Miltenyi Biotec) and centrifuged at 120g for 5 min at 4°C. Cells were resuspended 
in DPBS containing 1% BSA. Tomato+ cells were sorted on a BD Influx™ cell sorter, 
collected in ice cold PBS containing 0.04% BSA. The gating of cells was performed on BD 
FACS Software v. 1.0.0.650. 23,62% and 11,84% of singlets were captured at E15.5 and 
E18.5, respectively (see Supplementary Fig. 6 for representative plots). Single cell solutions 
were passed on for single cell RNA sequencing analysis.

Single cell RNA-sequencing

The sampling was carried out with 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell Kit (10x 
Genomics, CA, USA) Version 2 (embryonic cells) and Version 3 (juvenile cells) at the 
Eukaryotic Single Cell Genomics (ESCG), Stockholm, Sweden. Cell suspensions were 
adjusted to 500-1000 cells/μl, and added to 10x Chromium RT mix to achieve loading target 
numbers between 2500-8000 cells. The manufacturer’s instructions were followed for 
downstream cDNA synthesis, library preparation, and sequencing (Novaseq S1 reagent kit; 
100 cycles) using the Novaseq 6000 platform (Illumina). Cellranger version 2.1.1 was used 
for E15.5 and E18.5 datasets, and Cellranger version version 3.0.1 was used for P21 dataset.

Virally-mediated neuron labelling

ssAAV-PHP.S/2-shortCAG-dlox-EYFP(rev)-dlox-WPRE-hGHp(A) (abbreviated as PHP.S-
DIO-EYFP) and ssAAV-PHP.S/2-shortCAG-dlox-mRuby3(rev)-dlox-WPRE-hGHp(A) 
(abbreviated as PHP.S-DIO-mRuby3) were constructed at the Viral Vector Facility (VVF) of 
the Neuroscience Center Zurich (ZNZ) (# v309-PHP.S and v378-PHP.S respectively) using 
Addgene plasmids pUCmini-iCAP-PHP.S (#103006) and pAAV-CAG-DIO-EYFP 
(#104052). Procedure was performed as described.29 Cck-Ires-Cre were injected 
intravenously into the tail with 5.7*1011 viral dose. Animals were sacrificed 2-3 weeks after 
injection and tissue analyzed.

Tissue preparation for immunofluorescence (IF) analysis

Juvenile and adult small intestine sections—P21-90 small intestine was dissected, 
mesentery removed, and duodenum, jejunum and ileum separated. Intestinal pieces were 
flushed clean with ice-cold PBS and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS 
at 4°C. Some tissue was prepared as swiss-rolls.46 Briefly, the opened tissue pieces were 
placed flat, mucosa side down on the bottom of an empty petri dish. A toothpick was placed 
at one end and the tissue was rolled up to form a roll. The rolls were pinned to a Sylgaard-
covered dissection dish and fixed in 4% PFA at 4°C over-night. Tissues were then washed 
three times with PBS and incubated in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 °C and embedded 
in O.C.T. (Histolab, Leiden, The Netherlands), snap frozen and stored at −80 °C. The tissue 
was cut at 14 μm (20 μm for RNAscope  ®) and kept at −20 °C until use.

Adult myenteric plexus peels—Duodenum, jejunum and ileum intestinal segments 
from P21-90 mice were cleaned of mesentery and opened lengthwise along the mesenteric 
border. The intestinal contents were rinsed out with ice-cold PBS. The tissue was stretched 
and pinned with the mucosa side down on a Sylgaard-covered dissection dish and fixed in 
4% PFA at 4°C overnight. Tissue was then washed three times with PBS, longitudinal 
muscle-myenteric plexus-circular muscle layer peeled off (myenteric peels), cut into 1 cm2 
segments and stained directly or stored in 100% methanol at -20°C. In some cases, stretched 
fresh tissue was cultured overnight in DMEM (ThermoFisher) containing 10% heat-
inactivated fetal bovine serum (ThermoFisher), 100 U/ml penicillin (ThermoFisher), 100 
ug/ml streptomycin (ThermoFisher) and 0.1 mg/ml colchicine (Sigma). Thereafter, 
myenteric peels were prepared as above.

Embryonic tissue—Guts from E15.5 and E18.5 embryos were dissected out and fixed in 
4% PFA in PBS at 4°C for 2h. Samples were subsequently washed in PBS and cryoprotected 
in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4°C overnight. The tissue was then embedded in O.C.T. and frozen 
at -80°C. Samples were sectioned at 12-14 μm, dried at RT (room temperature) for 1h and 
further processed for IF or frozen at -20°C.

Immunofluorescence analysis

Frozen tissue sections (juvenile and embryonic) were air dried at RT for 1 hour, rinsed with 
PBS and incubated in blocking solution containing purified donkey anti-mouse Fab 
(Jackson, #715-007-003) diluted 1:50 in PBS for 1 hour at RT. Sections were then blocked 
with 2% normal donkey serum (NDS, Jackson) and 0,1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 1 
hour and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in the same solution overnight at 4°C. 
They were then washed 3 times with PBS (10 minutes each) and incubated with secondary 
antibodies at RT for 1 hour. Tissue was washed 3 times with PBS (10 minutes each) and 
mounted in DAKO mounting medium (Agilent) containing DAPI.

Myenteric peels were incubated in blocking solution containing purified donkey anti-mouse 
Fab diluted 1:50 in PBS and 0,3% Triton X-100 overnight at 4°C. The blocking solution was 
replaced by the incubation buffer containing 2% NDS, 1% BSA and 0,3% Triton X-100 in 
PBS for 8 hours at 4°C. The tissue was incubated in primary antibodies diluted in the 
incubation buffer for 48 hours 4°C, washed 3 times with PBS (30 minutes each) and then 
placed in the secondary antibodies diluted in the incubation buffer for 2 hours at RT. The 
tissue was washed 3 times with PBS (15 minutes each) and mounted on glass slides using 
DAKO mounting medium containing DAPI. For a complete list of primary and secondary 
antibodies, see Supplementary Table 2.

EdU labelling

Time plug-mated Pbx3-/- mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of 5-ethynyl-2’-
deoxyuridine (EdU; 0,1mg/g animal; Invitrogen) at E15.5. Mice were sacrificed 90 min after 
injection. Embryos were prepared for immunohistochemistry as described above. Tissue 
sections were first immuno-stained for SOX10 and then reacted for EdU using the Click iT® 
EdU Alexa Fluor ® 488 Imaging kit (Invitrogen). After 20 minutes slides were washed in 
PBS and mounted.

RNAscope® 

Imaging

RNAscope® was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions (RNAscope® 
Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v2 Assay) on 20μm sections. Protease III was used for 
tissue digestion. The following probes were used for the analysis: Mm-Nmu-C3 (Ref 
446831) and Mm-Cck-C2 and -C3 (Ref 402271). Immunohistochemistry (as described 
above) was applied after completion of RNAscope®.

Imaging of single plane or z-stacks was performed using Zeiss LSM700 or LSM800 
confocal microscopes (Oberkochen, Germany) using Zeiss ZEN 2010 software, and 
processed in Fiji image analysis software (version 2.0.0-rc-69/1.52i) (National Institutes of

Cell counting, statistical analysis and reproducibility

Counting of fluorescent cells was performed using the “Cell Counter” plugin in ImageJ or 
directly under a Zeiss fluorescent microscope. GraphPad Prism (version 8.4.1) was used to 
generate bar and box-and-whisker plots. In all graphs, error bars indicate mean ± Standard 
Deviation of the Mean (SD). Figure 4: Number of cells expressing various markers in 
myenteric peel preparations (approximately 1 cm2 pieces) were counted from at least 3 
animals. Percent expression was calculated on the combined jejunum and ileum counts. Cell 
sizes were measured on z-stack images. Two-sided student’s t-test was used for statistical 
analysis. Figure 7: Since the number of neurons can vary greatly between sections, we 
calculated the percentage of total neurons expressing a certain marker (Marker+ neurons) 
combining several sections. The ratio between the percentage Marker+ neurons in the 
mutant and that in the control is presented with the control normalized to 1. A minimum of 3 
sections was investigated per region of the gut in mutant and littermate WT embryos. Two-
sided Paired Student’s t test comparisons were performed for statistical examinations. 
Extended Data Fig. 3q: Quantification of ENC proportions was performed in C57BL/6 mice 
at 9-12 weeks (both females and males) using HUC/D or PGP9.5 for total neuron counts. 
For each ENC quantification, a minimum of 550 neurons/animal in sections and 1500 
neurons/animal in peels, were assessed. The following specific markers were used: ENC2-3: 
SUBP+/CALR-; ENC5: SST+; ENC6: Nmu + - (RNAscope, sections); ENC7: Cck + 
(RNAscope, sections); ENC8-10: NOS1+; ENC11: NPY+/NOS1- ENC12: CALB+/
NTNG1+. For ENC1/2, we counted the total ratio of CALR+ neurons, and deducted the 
mean percentages for ENC5, ENC11 and CALR+ ENC12 (64,6% ± 15,3). This percentage 
of CALR+ ENC12 was determined by counting the proportion of Nmu + neurons expressing 
CALR (n=423 Nmu + neurons, combined from duodenum, jejunum and ileum in 3 animals). 
Extended Data Fig. 5: The number of Reporter+ / RNA+ cells was evaluated in 20μm 
sections from jejunum and ileum of 3 animals. Both myenteric and submucosal Nmu+ 
neurons were counted. Marker+ cells in Figure 3 and Extended Data Fig. 3a-o and 5a-c are 
representative out of many more cells in at least two animals. Note that detailed statistics for 
many markers in Figure 3 are shown in Extended Data Fig. 3q. No statistical methods were 
used to pre-determine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in 
previous publications.17,47 Animals from different litters were used for repeat experiments to 
avoid confounding. Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions 
of the experiments. Samples with poor immunohistochemical staining quality were excluded 
from further analysis. Apparent unhealthy enteric ganglia (e.g. nuclear HUC/D staining) 
were excluded in neuron quantifications. Data distribution was assumed to be normal but 
this was not formally tested.

Analysis of single cell RNA-sequencing data

Clustering analysis—To identify molecularly distinct cell types in juvenile (P21) dataset, 
we classified the cells into transcriptionally similar clusters. We filtered 9,141 starting cells 
based on three quality control (QC) covariates: the number of UMI counts per cell, the 
number of genes per cell and the fraction of counts from mitochondrial genes per cell

(Extended Data Fig. 1a). Cells with <1,500 genes or >8,000 genes are removed. To mitigate 
potential doublets, we also excluded cells with >60,000 UMI counts. Of the remaining cells 
we further removed cells with the fraction of counts from mitochondrial genes <0.1 (for 
cells with <4000 genes) and <0.25 (for cells with >4000 genes) to account for injured cells. 
Downstream analysis was performed using the R package Seurat version 3.1.4.48 Briefly, we 
normalized the expression data using regularized negative binomial regression method49 
implemented in the SCTransform() function while regressing out contribution from 
mitochondrial gene counts, retaining 3,000 variable genes. Prominent sex specific genes 
(Xist, Gm13305, Tsix, Eif253y, Ddx3y, Uty) and a set of immediate early genes (Fos, Jun, 
Junb, Egr1) were removed from variable genes before principal component (PC) analysis. 
We then performed preliminary clustering with permissive parameters to identify and 
removed cluster that are of low quality and are non-enteric. At this level, we constructed K-
nearest neighbour graph based on Euclidian distance in 50 principal components (PCs) 
space and identified distinct communities of cells using Leiden algorithm (res. = 1.5; version 
0.3.3). We removed clusters that shows both high Plp1 and high Elavl4 as they likely 
represented neuron-glia contamination, and clusters that have low UMI counts per cells, low 
genes per cell and high fraction of mitochondrial genes, as the indication of low quality 
cells. The remaining cells were subject to second level clustering (35 PCs, res. = 1.0), 
yielding a clear separation of enteric glia and enteric neuron clusters. Only neuron clusters 
(4,892 cells in total) were retained for third level clustering (30 PCs, res. = 0.4), yielding 12 
final neuron clusters. The clusters were visualized on two dimensional using the 
RunUMAP() function (min.dist = 0.5, n_neighbors = 30L, umap.method = “umap-learn”, 
metric = “correlation”).

For embryonic datasets, we employed a similar approach, but with dataset-specific 
parameters and Louvain algorithm for clustering. We obtained 3,468 cells from E15.5. After 
removing cells with <1,000 genes or >6,000, with >40,000 UMI counts (to mitigate potential 
doublets), and with > 0.05 fraction of mitochondrial genes, we retained 3,260 cells for first 
level clustering (50 PCs, res. = 0.8). At this step, we removed one non-enteric cluster. The 
remaining cells were then subject to second level clustering (30 PCs, res. = 0.9), yielding 13 
clusters. Similarly, of 2,996 stating cells from E18.5, we removed cells with <1,000 genes or 
>8,000, with >40,000 UMI counts, and with > 0.1 fraction of mitochondrial genes, yielding 
2,733 remaining cells. We removed one non-enteric clusters at first level clustering (50 PCs, 
res. = 0.8). After second level clustering (30PCs, res. = 0.9), we obtained 15 clusters. We 
then performed differential expression analysis and, based on differential expressed genes, 
categorized each cluster as one of the following major cell types: neuron (Elavl4, Tubb3), 
neuroblast (Ascl1), progenitor (Sox10), enteric glia (S100b, Plp1), and Schwann cell 
precursor cells (high Plp1, Dhh). Clusters considered to share generic state were merged 
before re-analyzing differential expression to identify broad gene modules (Fig. 5; Extended 
Data Fig. 7). The clusters were visualized on two dimensional using the RunUMAP() 
function (for E15.5: min.dist = 0.48, n_neighbors = 69L, umap.method = “umap-learn”, 
metric = “correlation”; for E18.5: min.dist = 0.5, n_neighbors = 49L, umap.method = 
“umap-learn”, metric = “correlation”).

Differential expression analysis—To identify cluster-enriched genes, we performed 
non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test for cells in each cluster compared to all other cells. 
p-values were adjusted based on Bonferroni correction, giving false discovery rate (FDR). 
Genes with FDR <0.01, at least 0.25 average fold change (log-scale) and at least 25% 
cluster-specific detection (percent of cells expressing a particular gene in a cluster) were 
defined as enriched genes for each cluster. Top genes were then scrutinized in order of 
average fold change (log-scale).

Supervised cell type assignment—We used the hierarchical statistical framework 
CellAssign 50 (version 0.99.12) to compute the probability that each cell belongs to a cell 
type defined by a set of know makers genes. We used priori makers information gathered 
from previous studies. The curated markers were converted to binary codes before being 
used as an input to the model. Cell specific size factors were computed from the sizeFactor() 
function of the R package scarn (version 1.12.1). Individual cells were annotated to the cell 
type with maximum probability. For Fig. 1d and 1e, the following priori markers were used; 
Elavl4, Tubb3, Stmn2, Snap25 (enteric neuron); Sox10, Plp1, S100b (enteric glia); Ube2c, 
Top2a, Cenpef (cycling); Actg2, Mylk (smooth muscle). For presentation, we combined 
cells assigned to “cycling”, “smooth muscle” and “unassigned” to a new group, “Other”. 
Also note that, for comparison of cell types obtained from Wnt1Cre;R26Tomato and 
Baf53bCre;R26Tomato experiments (Fig. 1e), we applied the same permissive pre-
processing thresholding (UMI counts > 600) for both datasets. For Fig. 1i and 1j, priori 
markers were curated based on a series of immunohistochemical studies on the mouse small 
intestine.4–6 The following markers were used: Calca, Calcb, Chat, Slc18a3, Nefm, Calb1, 
Calb2 (IPAN); Chat, Slc18a3, Calb2, Tac1 (excitatory motor neuron); Nos1, Vip, Npy 
(inhibitory motor neuron); Chat, Slc18a3, Nos1, Vip (interneuron 1); Chat, Slc8a3, Calb2, 
Sst (interneuron 2); Chat, Slc18a3, Ddc, Slc6a4 (interneuron 3). For sex inference in 
Extended Data Fig. 1d and e, we used the following priori markers: Xist (female), and 
Eif2s3y, Ddx3y and Kdm5d (male).

Cell cycle assignment—For each cell, we computed a score based on its expression of 
G2/M and S phase markers; cells that express neither of these markers are likely not cycling 
or are in G0/G1 phase. The scoring strategy is described in Tirosh et al. 2016.51 We used 
Seurat’s implementation of this strategy in the CellCycleScoring() function.

Label transfer—For comparison of our newly proposed enteric neuron clusters to our 
previously reported ones (Extended Data Fig. 1c), we used expression data and cluster 
identities of enteric neurons at level L6 which can be found at http://mousebrain.org. The 
accession number for raw sequence data from Wnt1Cre;R26RTomato P21,23 animals is 
SRP135960, available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRP135960). Both datasets 
(Wnt1Cre;R26RTomato and Baf53bCre;R26RTomato) were subjected to the same pre-
processing steps using regularized negative binomial regression method49, while retaining 
original cluster identities, before undergoing Seurat’s label transfer52, using the 
FindTransferAnchors() function with 30 PCs and then the TransferData() function with 
Baf53bCre;R26Tomato dataset as the reference dataset. Finally, the mapping identities were 
presented as Alluvial plot using the R package ggalluvial (version 0.11.1).

For mapping of juvenile cell types to embryonic datasets (Fig. 6a,b), we employed similar 
approach as mentioned above. We compiled a juvenile reference dataset by combining 
enteric neurons from third level clustering (retaining their ENC1-12 identities) with enteric 
glial cells from second level clustering (removing cells with high expression of Elavl4 and 
Tubb3, and merging all subclasses to ‘enteric glia’), giving a total of 13 class identities (12 
ENCs and enteric glia). Here, we used 30 PCs for mapping of E15.5 dataset and 40 PCs for 
mapping of E18.5 dataset. Only cells with >0.5 maximum prediction score were mapped.

Computational screening of HGNC gene sets—To assess whether given gene sets 
can explain heterogeneity within the 12 ENCs, we performed a computational screening as 
previously described20, which is based on the MetaNeighbor (version 1.4.0.1) method.53 In 
brief, we defined a Spearmann correlation subnetwork of cells in our dataset by their 
expression of a given gene set, and performed a stratified cross-validation. In doing so, we 
divided our dataset into test and train sets and then held back cluster identity from one set at 
a time and predicted based on the other. The efficacy of cells of the same cluster were 
recovered for each cluster and reported as the area under the receiver operator characteristic 
curve (AUROC). We then ranked the gene sets by the mean AUROC. We perform this test 
on HGNC54 (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee) families curated by Paul et al. 201720, 
selecting only gene sets with more than three detectable genes.

Partition-based graph abstraction and pseudotime analysis—We used 
partitioned-based graph abstraction (PAGA) for interring developmental trajectories.55 We 
found this approach most suitable with our developmental datasets which consist of both 
cycling and branching topology. We used cluster identities from Louvain algorithm (as 
mentioned above) to define partitions of the graph of neighborhood relation among data 
points. PAGA was computed using the tl.paga() function implemented in the Python package 
Scanpy 1.4.5 post3.56 For pseudotime inference, we employed diffusion pseudotime method 
which infers progression of cells through geodesic distance along the graph.57 We used 
Scanpy’s tl.dpt(), setting the root at the cluster that most likely correspond to neuroblast, and 
the number of diffusion components to 10. Together with PAGA, which allowed detection of 
Branches, we were able to define developmental paths within each developmental dataset. 
Cells were then re-ordered within each path before plotting gene expression (Fig. 6h).

Gene pattern discovery—To find coordinated gene patterns, we performed non-negative 
matrix factorization (NMF) on E15.5 and E18.5 datasets using the R package CoGAPS 
version 3.4.1.58 In brief, CoGAPS decomposes this expression matrix into the amplitude 
matrix (A) and the pattern matrix (P). The rows of A and columns of P quantify the sources 
of variation among the genes and the cells, respectively. Each column of A and the 
corresponding row of P represent distinct sources of biological (or technical) variation in 
each cell. We constructed the ‘counts’ matrix of 3000 high variable genes, excluding 
prominent sex specific genes (Xist, Gm13305, Tsix, Eif253y, Ddx3y, Uty) and a set of 
immediate early genes (Fos, Jun, Junb, Egr1), before decomposing it using the CoGAPS() 
function (nPatterns = 7, nIterations = 1000). The PatternMarker statistics was computed as 
previously described.59 The list of pattern markers was manually curated, together with

differentially expressed genes from cluster analysis, to infer plausible biological processes 
represented by each pattern.

RNA velocity—We predicted the direction of transcriptional changes in the E15.5 and 
E18.5 datasets using the RNA velocity framework, which estimates the gene expression 
dynamics from exonic and intronic expression.60 We first annotated spliced, unspliced and 
spaning reads using the run10x command (velocyto.py). Genes were filtered based on 
average expression per cluster retaining ones with > 0.5 (for spliced) and > 0.05 (for 
unsliced). RNA velocities were then predicted using the gene-relative model implemented in 
the R package velocyto.R (version 0.6) with the k.nearest cell pooling = 10 (for E15.5) or 50 
(for E18.5), fit.qualtile = 0.02, and deltaT = 1). To improve the estimates, we took cell-cell 
distance from Seurat’s processing steps, instead of using the velocyto.R’s default whole-
transcriptome correlation distance. We represented RNA velocity estimated on UMAP with 
a regular grid coordinated (scale = ‘sqrt’). The direction of the arrows denotes the estimated 
future state of the current cells. Long arrows correspond to large gene expression changes 
and thus can intuitively imply that cells are undergoing rapid differentiation. While the 
lengths of arrows in low-dimensional representation such as UMAP need to be interpreted 
with caution, they are likely biologically meaningful.
